The attacker's address:  
https://bscscan.com/address/0x731821d13414487ea46f1b485cfb267019917689  
  
The contract used for the attack:  
https://bscscan.com/address/0xa5312796dc20add51e41a4034bf1ed481b708e71  
  
The attacker:  
\- took a 53.25 BTC flash loan from Cream Finance  
  
\- used 53.25 BTC to get a 2,717,107 TUSD loan from Venus  
  
\- manipulated the price of BNB/TUSD Pool on PancakeSwap  
  
\- used 50 different contracts, deployed earlier to deposit 38,250 TUSD into HUNNY TUSD Vault  
  
\- redeemed 2842.16TUSD and minted 12,020.40 Hunny  
  
\- sold minted Hunny for 7.78 WBNB  
  
 -repeated with 50 wallets 26 times.  
  
The hack is made possible by a profit inflation flaw that transforms a little number of harvested ALPACA into a big sum of TUSD for staking. These converted TUSDs are then counted as profit, which is subsequently inflated to produce a big quantity of HUNNY.  
  
Stolen funds were bridged on Ethereum blockchain and deposited into Tornado Cash mixer:
