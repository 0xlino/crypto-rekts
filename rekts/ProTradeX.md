**Quick Summary**

ProTradeX was rugpulled by the token deployer. The scammer profited for 698,147 $USD and moved the funds into TornadoCash.

 

 **Details of the Exploit**

ProTradeX is a BEP20 token trading in the smart contract directly. The token's symbol is PTD and can't be confused with other similar tokens. The token deployer collected the funds from multiple EOA addresses using unverified and malicious smart contracts and then moved them through TornadoCash. The total amount reached 698,147 $USD. The remaining $PTD tokens were transferred to another EOA address which deployed a new $USDT/$PTD pool with an unverified source code, probably to continue to scam users.
