The BabyDogePair pool was affected by a flash loan attack. The attack started after the exploiter deployed a malicious contract and took 80,000 $BNB as a flash loan. Consequently, the price of $BabyDoge was manipulated by the attacker, and then 80,509 $BNB was drained from the pool. The flashloan was repaid and the attacker's profit reached 437 $BNB which is worth 135,013 $USD at the moment. The stolen assets were transferred to a couple of EOA addresses which were then transferred to the FixedFloat crypto exchange.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xcbc0d0c1049eb011d7c7cfc4ff556d281f0afebb</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x098e7394a1733320e0887f0de22b18f5c71ee18d48a0f6d30c76890fb5c85375<br><br>Funds transfer transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x2ca8b77b4497498e274869639dbc10bd30e66719bf788d01a180841daa9a0c6f</p><p><br></p><p>FixedFloat transfer:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x66e2373dfb5265e8cb724e3295e47fd93d3b6b7c2aed07801d399b49a3344925<br><br>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x51873a0b615a51115f2cfbc2e24d9db4bfa2e6e2</p>",
