    "description": "<p>An attacker attempted to exploit the Solend smart contract. They subverted an insecure auth check on the <u>UpdateReserveConfig()</u> function to make accounts with borrows liquidatable and set the borrow APY to 250% for all markets. The attempt to steal funds was detected and stopped by the Solend team in time such that no funds were stolen. A handful of users (5) were liquidated by Solend's liquidator, but those users were refunded out of the liquidator's undue earnings (~16K USD).<br><br>The attacker's address:<br>https://explorer.solana.com/address/5ELHytHM4cvKUPCWX8HPwkwtw3J866Wtexdpo8PPxp2u<br><br>The attacker submitted a total of 10 txs: 9 of them to So1endDq2YkqhipRh3WViPa8hdiSpxWy6z3Z6tMCpAo (the Solend program address) and one of them to Port7uDYB3wk6GJAw4KT1WpTeMtSu9bTcChBHkX2LfR (the Port program address).<br><br>The attacker's wallet was funded by 2ojv9BAiHUrvsm9gxDe7fJSzbNZSJcxZvf8dqmWGHG8S which appears to be an exchange wallet.</p>",
