**Quick Summary**

The cBridge was the victim of a DNS attack during which users who used the bridge through the web interface lost their funds. During the attack, the total damage from users amounted to about $240k.

 **  
Details of the Exploit**

Celer cBridge is a decentralized and non-custodial asset bridge that supports 110+ tokens across 30+ blockchains and layer-2 rollups.

A vulnerability in the hosting security system was used by a hacker to gain control of the bridge domain and change the external interface to redirect funds passing through the platform to a wallet controlled by the hacker.

Unsuspecting people made exchanges from one blockchain to another and noticed that they could not get their funds. Team members noticed this and issued a warning post on Twitter.

Before the Celer Network team noticed the problem, the hacker managed to take $ETH 128 and withdraw all funds through Tornado.Cash.
