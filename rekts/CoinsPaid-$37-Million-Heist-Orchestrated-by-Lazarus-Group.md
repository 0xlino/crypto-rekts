**Quick Summary**

Crypto payments provider CoinsPaid suffered a $37 million heist orchestrated by North Korea's Lazarus Group. The attack involved six months of social engineering, culminating in an employee being manipulated via a deceptive job offer.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**  

The $37 million heist on CoinsPaid was executed by North Korea's Lazarus Group through a sophisticated campaign spanning six months. The attack focused on social engineering tactics, with hackers relentlessly targeting CoinsPaid's team members. The campaign involved spam, phishing, fake job offers, and bribery attempts.

  


The climax of the attack occurred on July 22 when an employee, believing they were being interviewed for a job with Crypto.com, unwittingly downloaded malicious software as part of a technical test. The hackers leveraged their extensive research on CoinsPaid, including its team structure, to create a convincing story that exploited the employee's trust.

  


Upon infiltrating the system, the hackers exploited a software vulnerability to gain authorized access to CoinsPaid's hot wallets. While they couldn't directly access private keys, they successfully withdrew most of the funds to decentralized exchanges like SwftSwap, SunSwap, and SimpleSwap. Funds were also routed through mixers to obscure their movement.

  


CoinsPaid emphasized the necessity of employee training to recognize social engineering tactics and the significance of recognizing seemingly insignificant hack attempts as potential precursors to larger operations. Despite impacting the company's revenue, no customer funds were lost.
