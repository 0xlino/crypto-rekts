Mintpal faced a major hack on the 13th of July, causing 8,000,000 Vericoin to be stolen (value $2,000,000), which was about 30% of the circulating supply at the time. The exchange had kept their Vericoin on a “hot” wallet (an online, internet-connected wallet), which is much more vulnerable.

Interestingly enough, the Bitcoin and Litecoin wallets were also targeted for the Mintpal hack. This turned out unsuccessful. The exchange had wisely decided to move these to a “cold” wallet (an offline wallet).
