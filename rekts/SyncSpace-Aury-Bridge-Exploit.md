Aurory's SyncSpace bridge on Arbitrum's native DEX - Camelot, was targeted in an exploit. The attacker exploited the marketplace's buy endpoint, inflating their AURY token balance in SyncSpace. This allowed them to withdraw nearly 550,000 tokens to the Arbitrum network and liquidate the stolen amount in the market.The attacker swapped AURY tokens to USDC on the AURY-USDC liquidity pool in 9 transactions. Stolen funds were distributed among multiple addresses and deposited into Binance and FixedFloat exchanges.
