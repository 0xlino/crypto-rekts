"the stock market suffered a hack attack in June 2013 in which 1,300 bitcoins were stolen...PicoStocks announced that it had been robbed again. This time a total of 5,896 bitcoins were missing from both its “hot” and “cold” wallets. Because cold wallets can’t be accessed in online attacks, the theft may have been an inside job."
