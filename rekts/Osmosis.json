    "description": "<p>Osmosis has been rugged by liquidity pool providers. Size of loss is ~$5M. One of the attackers added liquidity USDC and OSMO. The attacker then received GAMM LP tokens in return, which represented his share in the pool. They immediately revoked GAMM LP tokens, thereby receiving 50% more than the amount of USDC and OSMO that were added as liquidity.</p><p><br></p><p>Token address: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/account/osmo1w4x44ek799hvg97x0mfwu6gg5dww2r8fhkgrgj</p><p>Example transaction: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/account/osmo1hq8tlgq0kqz9e56532zghdhz7g8gtjymdltqer</p><p><br></p><p>Attack example step by step:</p><p>1.
