The exchange's staff published a message on Facebook which stated that due "to an error and ongoing maintenance works” the platform had decided to "temporarily shut down [its] service”.  
  
A statement from the company said:

"We successfully blocked a hacking attack on Bitcurex, preventing mass theft of BTC funds of our users. Thanks to automatic safety procedures, hackers managed to defraud only a portion of the funds stored in operational Hot Wallet Bitcurex. The majority of funds from Hot Wallet, as well the entirety of funds from Cold Wallet and FIAT monetary funds remained intact."
