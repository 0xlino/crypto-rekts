The contract itself does not have an issue with standard ERC20, but since the PLX token is ERC777 standard, there will be <u>tokenReceived</u>() callback event every time method <u>transfer</u>() triggered. The attacking smart contract deployed by the hacker has included the <u>unlockAll</u>() trigger repeatedly (40 times) in the event, so he was able to unlock more than the amount he locked in before.<br><br>The attacker:<br>- locked 15,711,384 PLX in the Locker, received 15,711,384 fPLX</p><p>- unlocked all 15,711,384 fPLX from the Locker, received 1,184,289 PLX</p><p>- in the <u>tokenReceived</u>() called <u>unlockAll</u>() function</p><p>- repeated previous step 40 times.<br><br>Stolen tokens were sold on USDC, which then were bridged on Ethereum:<br>https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xe02124b1a2fa3c4d7f0bad162f06c96688f5911951010063ac7f65ef4b6bd1ad</p>",
