The contract itself had a logic issue, which allowed anyone to become a contract owner and withdraw fees for themselves. The constructor of the contract was named wrong and become a regular function. After becoming a contract owner, anyone can call the unprotected function collectAllFees() to withdraw fees. The contract currently has only 4 $ETH, which is stuck and can't be withdrawn.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Deployment transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4496b64234e97bb7ed008d09938fb9e94ecf3461cbd89a5eabda356a098f8ec3</p><p><br></p><p>Contract deployer:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd68da49b2a0c46eb508bd4f18044b5c6268ad60</p><p><br></p><p>Owner change example:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9385dca4891753f8ba5817964e5321849b5c7172f5a669aee144344d0610684c</p><p><br></p><p>Withdrawal example:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x580222b06bad8c57c83c6edc89afac196f3e571026041e75625bb60cbe7dd472</p>",
