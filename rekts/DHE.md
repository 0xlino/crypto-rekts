 **Details of the exploit  **

The project promised its investors to revolutionize content ownership through NFTs and thus making content tradable on its own platform, denominated in $DHE.

 The owners of the project never intended to make due on this promise as a large amount of $DHE token were minted to a specific wallet at inception resulting in a massive centralization issue from the start. Within 5min in the evening of the 20th June the scammer decided to dump his $DHE token through pancake swap.
