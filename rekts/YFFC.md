 **Details of the Exploit**

YFFC was supposed to be a platform that unites a variety of DeFi platforms, ensuring an easier navigation through the crypto space for users. However, the smart contract contained a function that allowed contract deployer to mint as many $YFFC token as desired. 

The contract deployer added initial liquidity at:

Almost 2 months after adding liquidity and once the $YFFC token was trading at an acceptable price for the contract deployer, the exploit started.
