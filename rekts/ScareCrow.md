The development team has abandoned the project.  
  
Their announcement:  
"We're sorry to announce but due to continued down pressure of the raven and scare token, dotcom twitter fud campaign and continued fud by both investors and non investors in the group and the vault issues, Raven will continue as is until it hits its supply of 160k tokens. we will not be making another layer.  
  
We will not be developing the ScareCrow Finance project any further. The websites will be live until all tokens have been distributed as rewards.  
  
If you need to use the contracts to withdraw at a later date, please use ftmscan to interact with the masterchef and withdraw your funds. Instructions to do so can be found through research online."  
  
The conclusion of the on-chain analysis did not show a fact of scam on the part of the team.
