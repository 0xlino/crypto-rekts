**Quick Summary**

GMBL Computer, a DeFi Gambling Protocol on Arbitrum, suffered a referral system exploit, resulting in the loss of 768,196 $USD worth 471.33 ETH.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

GMBL Computer is a DeFi Gambling Protocol running on the Arbitrum chain. On September 5, 2023, the project's referral system was exploited. The attacker took advantage of a vulnerability that allowed them to place "Ghost" bets on a game, which were registered as losses, and thus enabled the claiming of 5% of these "Ghost" bet losses. The attacker placed massive "Ghost" bets with one account that was referred by another account, allowing the second account to claim over 8 million $GMBL in referrals before the exploit was stopped. The stolen funds were swapped for ETH and sent to another EOA. Out of the stolen 471.33 ETH, 235.5 ETH was later returned.
