In addition, hundreds of small transfers of 10,000, 20,000, and 200,000 BONDLY were made to numerous wallet addresses, which we believe were owned by the Attacker. In addition to Bondly tokens, the transfers included 271,790,246 $BONDLY BSC tokens and 6,620,128 $BONDLY Polygon tokens.<br><br>The attacker moved 3,569 Uniswap V2 liquidity tokens from compromised Bondly wallets to the Attacker\u2019s wallet.
