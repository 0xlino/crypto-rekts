**Quick Summary**

A soft rugpull was noticed in the $APC token. The team took away approximately 1200 $BNB in profit.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The creator of the token deployed the contract to the BSC network, where 100M tokens were minted on the address (B):

Address (B) sent 150k $APC to the address (C) in this transaction:

Then address (C) interacted with address (D) that later transferred 1200 $BNB through Tornado.cash:

Address (E) received 1M $USDT from Binance Hot Wallet and 14 $BNB from Tornado.cash which then distributed funds to the bot addresses:

Bots started creating fake trade volume in order to attract investor's attention in this project. When investors deposited funds into the token, part of the money ~1.2M $USDT was sent to address (D) in multiple transactions.

Example transactions:

1) https://bscscan.com/tx/0x542f6f8c43eb79bd46aa1f09dbc1502f65c60c4f7dae33ffdd018b0230d2edf3

Then 1200 $BNB was withdrawn via Tornado.cash.
