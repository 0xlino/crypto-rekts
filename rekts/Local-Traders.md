**Quick Summary**

Local Traders, a P2P exchange on Binance Smart Chain was exploited due to a lack of permission checks in their smart contract. The attacker modified the owner and token price resulting in a loss of 115,595 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

On May 23, 2023, the Local Traders platform was exploited on the Binance Smart Chain resulting in a loss of approximately 379.32 BNB worth around $115,595 at that time. The vulnerability was caused by a lack of permission checks in one of their functions which allowed anyone to modify the owner using this function implementation. The attacker then called another function to modify the price of LCT tokens to purchase them at low prices and sold them for profit. All stolen funds are currently held by the attacker's address which has been reported and blacklisted by exchanges making it difficult for the hacker to cash out. The Local Traders team is working on implementing a recovery plan for affected users.
