    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>TempleDAO's staking contract was exploited due to a vulnerable migration functionality. The hacker took away FraxLP tokens and swapped them for 1830 $ETH.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>TempleDAO is a DeFi yield aggregator. The exploit happens due to stake migration functionality on the StaxLPStaking contract. The attacker was able to transfer xFraxTempleLP liquidity tokens to his address and took $TEMPLE and $FRAX tokens from the pool. Consequently, the hacker swapped them for 1830 $ETH and transferred the stolen funds to another EOA address. The total profit of the attacker reached 2,376,872 $USD. An interesting detail is that the attacker's address was linked to Binance's address. TempleDAO is investigating the accident with Binance and Stax said that a white hat bounty will be initialized for the exploiter.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x9c9Fb3100A2a521985F0c47DE3B4598dafD25B01</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8c3f442fc6d640a6ff3ea0b12be64f1d4609ea94edd2966f42c01cd9bdcf04b5</p><p><br></p><p>Liquidity removal transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4b119a4f4ba1ad483e9851973719f310527b43f3fcc827b6d52db9f4c1ddb6a2</p>",
