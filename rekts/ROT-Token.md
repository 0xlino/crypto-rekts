**Quick Summary**

ROT token project rugpulled by the deployer for 116,150 $USD after blacklisting the other token holders.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

ROT is a BEP20 token trading on PancakeSwap, which cannot be confused with other projects carrying similar symbols or names. An investigation revealed that its liquidity pool was drained after a malicious action in which the token deployer used privilege over contracts to modify functions like transferFrom(). The tokens' contract was rigged to blacklist holders and prevent them from selling their ROT. Consequently, several buyers could not sell their holdings as they have been blacklisted already at this point.

The attacker then removed all available LP funds worth 116,150$ USD over two transactions spread across three days.
