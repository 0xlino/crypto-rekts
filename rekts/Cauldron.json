    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>The biggest flash loan attack on Avalanche in 2022 was detected. The attacker took 370,000 $USD after interacting with several assets.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The attacker interacted with Cauldron, Aave, JoeSwap, and Curve for various purposes. The attacker used a malicious smart contract with an unverified source code to withdraw 998,000 $nxUSD using LP tokens worth 500,000 $USDC. The full attack flow of the exploit transaction succeeded as follows:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. The attackers malicious contract flashloaned 51,000,000 $USDC from Aave</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. 280,000 $USDC were swapped to $WAVAX with JoeSwap</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. liquidity was added using claimed $WAVAX and 260,000 $USDC so 0.0045 JoeLPToken was received</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. The remaining 50,460,000 $USDC were swapped for $WAVAX on JoeSwap and it changed the reserve of the pool</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;5. The attackers contract called the updateExchangeRate function on the CauldronV2 smart contract, which changed the ExchangeRate variable according to the previous JoeSwap pool's reserve amount</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;6. The attackers contract deposited 0.0045 JoeLPToken to the CauldronV2 and 998,000 $nxUSD were withdrawn from DegenBox. Because of the manipulated ExchangeRate variable, the attacker was able to take that amount for 500,000 $USD worth JoeLPTokens</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;7. The remaining $WAVAX were swapped back for 50,426,896 $USDC on the previous JoeSwap pool</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;8. Consequently, Curve.fi and other pools were used to swap 998,000 $nxUSD for 970,010 $USDC</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;9. The 51,025,500 $USDC for the flash loan were paid back to Aave</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;10. The profit amounted to 371,406 $USDC and were transferred to an EOA address.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>CauldronV2 vulnerable contract:</p><p>https://snowtrace.io/address/0xe767c6c3bf42f550a5a258a379713322b6c4c060</p><p>Exploit transaction:</p><p>https://snowtrace.io/tx/0x0ab12913f9232b27b0664cd2d50e482ad6aa896aeb811b53081712f42d54c026</p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://snowtrace.io/address/0x69992a2e5d6ec031ab16733975110f0b43a0b1af</p><p>Attacker smart contract:</p><p>https://snowtrace.io/address/0x16b94c6358fe622241d055811d829281836e49d6</p><p>DegenBox contract:</p><p>https://snowtrace.io/address/0x0b1f9c2211f77ec3fa2719671c5646cf6e59b775</p><p>Stolen funds sent to:</p><p>https://snowtrace.io/address/0x8ec74e6f9627d445f546cdc606a35a3334378381</p><p><br></p>",
