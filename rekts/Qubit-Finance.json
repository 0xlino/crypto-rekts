    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>Qubit Finance lending protocol was hacked due to smart contract vulnerability. The hacker minted $xETH tokens to steal 80,000,000 worth of $BNB</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Qubit Finance is DeFi protocol for lending and borrowing on both Ethereum and Binance SmartChain. The protocol confirmed a hack on Twitter, 206,809 $BNB was stolen which was worth 80,000,000 $USD up to that time. The attack flow is below:<br>The attacker:<br>- funded his wallet with 0.8887725 ETH from Tornado Cash</p><p>- sent 16 deposit transactions to QBridge of Ethereum</p><p>- sent 16 <u>voteProposal</u> transactions to QBridge contract of BSC by Qubit Relayer</p><p>&nbsp;- a number of $xETH tokens were minted by 16 <u>voteProposal</u> transactions, and liquidity in Qubit was withdrawn using this as collateral.<br><br>The attacker called the QBridge deposit function on the Ethereum network, which calls the deposit function QBridgeHandler. QBridgeHandler should receive the $WETH token, which is the original <u>tokenAddress</u>, and if the person who performed the tx does not have a $WETH token, the transfer should not occur.<br><br><u>tokenAddress.safeTransferFrom</u>(depositer, address(this), amount);<br><br>In the deposit function above, <u>tokenAddress</u> is 0, so <u>safeTransferFrom</u> didn\u2019t fail and the deposit function ended normally regardless of the amount value. Additionally, <u>tokenAddress</u> was the $WETH address before <u>depositETH</u> was added, but as <u>depositETH</u> is added, it is replaced with the zero address that is the <u>tokenAddress</u> of ETH.<br><br>In summary, the deposit function was a function that should not be used after <u>depositETH</u> was newly developed, but it remained in the contract, which allows the attacker to use this to steal the funds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xD01Ae1A708614948B2B5e0B7AB5be6AFA01325c7</p>",
