**Quick Summary**

Hypr OP Stack Bridge exploited due to a smart contract vulnerability, resulting in a loss of 2,570,000 HYPR tokens worth 215,193 USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Hypr OP Stack Bridge, a bridge between Ethereum Mainnet and Hypr Network, was compromised on December 13, 2023. The exploit occurred due to a vulnerability that resulted from using a non-production-ready branch of the OP monorepo, which contained a critical vulnerability. This vulnerability allowed the reinitialization of the contract, enabling the attacker(s) to drain funds. The stolen funds were subsequently sold on the open market, leading to a decline in the price of Hypr. The total loss from this exploit was approximately 215,193 USD, which is equivalent to 2,570,000 HYPR tokens.
