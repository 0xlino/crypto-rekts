**Quick Summary**

##  CryptoBurgers suffered a flashloan attack that was possible due to a bug in the token contract. The estimated loss is $770K.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

##  The token contract had a bug in the external burn() function that allowed hackers to burn tokens of any address. Using this vulnerability, the hacker performed multiple flash loan attacks. The burn of $BURG was pumping its price in the pair. So the hacker first bought $BURG, burned tokens in a PancakeSwap pair, and sold their overpriced $BURG.
