**Quick Summary**

On the 4th of July 4 2022, the trading and lending platform Vauld freezed user withdrawals. 

  


 **Details of the Case**

Vauld faced financial challenges due to market conditions, such as the Terra Luna crash and paused withdrawals by Celsius, and financial difficulties of the platform’s key business partners. 

Following withdrawals from Vauld of about $200 million that happened in 25 days after Terra's case, the platform’s management decided to stop all deposits and further withdrawals.
