The fees were pocketed by the validator that processed the transaction, which was processed by an MEV-Boost relay belonging to Flashbots, the most prominent organization within the MEV sphere. The transaction used a block-builder from builder0x69. It remains unclear which, if any, of the parties involved is responsible for manipulating the gas fee to such heights.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Victim Address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xBB1D6b3BE1396a4b5CCb8D061b302250bB2b73Fd</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4a84d0872887f91546cd5400cf99763b654975efb3376ee55e4463bcfbca4e97</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Contract Address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x6465fa41eA2293098BfB71A8A84D84B68d112865</p>",
