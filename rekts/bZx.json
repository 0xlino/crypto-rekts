The margin trading function leveraged KyberSwap to swap the borrowed 5637.623762 ETH for 51.345576 WBTC in return. Notice that it is 5x borrow to short ETH. The swap essentially drove up the conversion rate of 1 WBTC to around 109.8 WETH, roughly triple the normal conversion rate (~38.5 WETH/WBTC)<br><br>- with the spiked WBTC price on Uniswap, the attacker sold the Compound-borrowed 112 WBTC back for WETH on Uniswap. This dump step leads to the net of 6871.4127388702245 ETH in return with the overall conversation rate of 1WBTC=61.4 WETH<br><br>- With the netted 6871.4127388702245 ETH from the dumped 112 WBTC, the attacker repaid the flash loan 10000.000000000011ETH back to dYdX.</p>",
