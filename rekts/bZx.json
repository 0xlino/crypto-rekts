The attacker was able to mint 219,200 LINK tokens (worth about $2.6 million); 4,503 ETH (~$1.6 million); 1,756,351 USDT (~$1.7 million); 1,412,048 USDC (~$1.4 million) and 667,989 DAI (~$680,000). The total loss amounted to approximately $8.1 million. bZx has assured that no user funds are at risk as the loss is being covered by its insurance fund.</p><p><br></p>",
