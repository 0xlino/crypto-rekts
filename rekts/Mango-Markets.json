The attacker profited from the total amount of 116,000,000 $USD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>Mango Markets is a DeFi Exchange on the Solana chain. The attacker used two addresses to pump the $MNGO price and used the tokens to take a loan of 116,000,000 $USD from various pools. From the first address, the attacker bought $MNGO tokens for 5,000,000 $USDC and created opened position. From the second address, the same amount of the tokens have been bought and a long position opened for hedging purposes. Consequently, the attacker was able to pump the token price due to little liquidity in the pool. After the accident, the exploiter opened a proposal on MangoDAO for returning the user's deposit funds for immunity, turning Mango users against the DEX. That's also interesting that the attacker's address was funded by an FTX address.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://solscan.io/account/yUJw9a2PyoqKkH47i4yEGf4WXomSHMiK7Lp29Xs2NqM</p>",

After the finish of the proposal of returning part of the funds, the hacker and the Mango team decided to mark 47,000,000 $USD as a bug bounty for the hacker and returning of the remaining 69,000,000 $USD. A Twitter user named Abraham Eisenberg took the responsibility for the funds removal and said that it was not illegal action because he performed actions as the project was designed.</p>"
