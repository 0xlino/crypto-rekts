**Quick Summary**

EthereumHive project exploited, resulting in the loss of 744 million EHIVE tokens worth 15,569 USD (9.32 ETH).

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

EthereumHive, a project running on the Ethereum chain, was exploited on August 21, 2023, through a reentrancy attack. The attacker used a rewarding issue in the EHIVE token's smart contract which allowed stakes with zero amount. They created multiple contracts and staked 0 EHIVE tokens from each of them. By calling stake and unstake immediately in each contract, the attacker increased reward amounts, ultimately minting 744 million EHIVE tokens. These tokens were exchanged for over 9 ETH, equivalent to 15,569 USD. The stolen funds were deposited into TornadoCash.
