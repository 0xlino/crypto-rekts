**Quick Summary**

Midas Capital, a lending platform, was exploited resulting in a loss of over 600,000 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The Midas Capital, a borrowing and lending platform on the Binance Smart Chain, was exploited by a logic flaw in one of its contracts with unverified source code. As a result, the attacker was able to drain over 600,000 $USD worth of various tokens in stablecoins and $BNB. Part of the stolen amount was swapped for 510 $BNB and then transferred through TornadoCash. The contract misused the redeem counter which, when provided with different amounts of HAY/BUSD AMM tokens, gave back multiple times the token value, behaving much like a free ATM.
