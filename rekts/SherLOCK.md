**Quick Summary**

SherLOCK token's liquidity was totally removed by the token owner. The scammer drained 938 $BNB from the PancakeSwap liquidity pool.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

SherLOCK is BEP20 token, and can't be confused with the SherLOCK Security project on the Ethereum chain. The token was deployed on 5th September 2022, and users couldn't sell their $LOCK tokens after buying. On 21st September, the token deployer removed 938 $BNB from the PancakeSwap liquidity pool. Consequently, 520 $BNB was transferred to Tornado Cash from the original address, and the remaining funds were transferred to another EOA address.
