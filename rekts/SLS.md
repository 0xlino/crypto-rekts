**Quick Summary**

SLS project's token GSLS lost the price by more than 85% after the token deployer-related EOA address drained liquidity. The scammer made a profit of 41,122 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

GSLS is the BEP20 token trading on PancakeSwap. On 3rd October, the token deployer sent 40,000 $GSLS to EOA address. The address received 25,000 $BUSD from another address and added liquidity with them and received $GSLS to the liquidity pool on PancakeSwap. Consequently, the scammer made many trades with small amounts at the beginning. When the initial token holder sent 360,000 $GSLS to the scammer, the tokens were sold immediately, which leads to the token price dump and liquidity draining for the total amount of 41,122 $BUSD.
