**Quick Summary**

Trade Coin Club founders were running a Ponzi Scheme by conning investors for a fraudulent crypto trading bot. Roughly 295,000,000 $USD worth of $BTC was scammed.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Trade Coin Club is an investment company, which promises "minimum returns of 0,35% daily" by "performing millions of microtransactions per second". The company ran a Ponzi Scheme and actually had no trading bot. The funds from 100,000 worldwide investor's deposits were withdrawn directly by the four people to enrich themselves.
