**Quick Summary**

The MetaDao Honeypot caused investors approx. $ 2,8 million in damages.

 **  
Details of the Exploit**

MetaDAO claimed to be the DAO of DAOÂ´s, building a new decentralized universe when in fact the project was a Honeypot all along. The $META token was configured in such a way that it could not be sold on decentralized exchanges, meaning investors funds were trapped. The contract deployer added initial liquidity at:

Once the project took on steam, the contract deployer unlocked liquidity and removed $ETH from the pair in the following example transactions:
