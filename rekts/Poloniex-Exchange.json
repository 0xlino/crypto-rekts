    "description": "<p>Digital currency exchange Poloniex has lost 12.3% of its total bitcoin supply in an attack.<br><br>The exchange took to Bitcoin Forum on 4th March to report it had been compromised by a previously unknown vulnerability in its coding:<br>https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=499580<br><br>Poloniex owner Tristan D'Agosta:<br>\"The hacker discovered that if you place several withdrawals all in practically the same instant, they will get processed at more or less the same time. This will result in a negative balance, but valid insertions into the database, which then get picked up by the withdrawal daemon.\"<br><br>D'Agosta also stated that Poloniex compensated users:<br>\"97 BTC were taken and 97 BTC were paid back. Although the value of bitcoin fluctuated, it is not very different now from what it was in the beginning of March.\"</p>",
