**Quick Summary**

Webaverse, a Web3 metaverse game engine, lost $4 million in a cryptocurrency hack during a meeting with con artists posing as investors in a hotel lobby in Rome.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The cryptocurrency was taken from a recently created Trust Wallet during the meeting, and the hack happened despite the co-founder not being connected to a public WiFi network, and no one possibly seeing the private key. The money was split into six transactions and sent to six new addresses, none of which had any prior activity, before being almost entirely converted using 1inch's swap address feature into Ether (ETH), wrapped-Bitcoin (wBTC), and Tether (USDT).
