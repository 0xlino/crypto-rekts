**Quick Summary**

FEG Token team is attempting to recover $280,000 in liquidity after an exploit of the project’s migration tool to its upgraded Smart DeFi 2.0 token.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The FEG Token team is attempting to recover about $280,000 in liquidity that was stolen during an exploit of the project’s migration tool to its upgraded Smart DeFi 2.0 token. The exploit affected liquidity only on the BNB Chain side of the token. The team has met with Centralized Exchange partners and security experts to determine next steps, including exploring the option of a liquidity provider for FEGbsc, looking at splitting liquidity between BNB Chain and Ethereum for a short while, pursuing efforts to recover $280,000 in liquidity via a 10% bounty and tracking, and using airdrops and a freshly audited migration tool to complete the migration.
