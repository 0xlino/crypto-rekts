**Quick Summary**

Onyx Protocol suffered a flash loan attack, exploiting a rounding issue, leading to a loss of approximately 2,149,772 USD worth 1,161.29 ETH.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Onyx Protocol, a decentralized liquidity protocol, was exploited on November 1, 2023, through a flash loan attack. The attacker took advantage of a critical vulnerability in CompoundV2 forks, which caused a known rounding issue. To execute the exploit, the attacker took out a substantial flash loan in ETH, swiftly converting it to PEPE tokens and contributing PEPE tokens to a specific pool. Due to precision loss, fewer shares were burned, enabling the withdrawal of assets. The exploit resulted in a loss of approximately 2,149,772 USD worth 1,161.29 ETH. The attacker has already laundered about 1,140 ETH (equivalent to 1.25 million USD) to the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash.
