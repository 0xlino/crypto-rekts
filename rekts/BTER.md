BTER reported that 50m NXT, or roughly $1.65m at press time, has been stolen from its exchange following an attack on one of its hosting servers.  
  
A developer representing the China-based digital currency exchange platform confirmed the news on the community information website NXT Forum, suggesting that the BTER team was considering urging the NXT community to roll back the NXT block chain to recover the lost funds.  
  
BTER announced on Twitter that it would seek to retrieve the stolen funds through other means.  
  
The company said: "We have decided not to rollback but get the stolen funds back from the hacker since we have got lots of information of him."
