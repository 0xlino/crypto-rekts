    "description": "<p>A user claimed on Twitter that he had mistakenly entered an NFT auction scam and was taken away by an art website worth $336K dollars in Ethereum.<br><br>The hacker returned 100 ETH in full. In this scam, the victim reported that he inquired about the NFT auction from a certain Discord chat, and then he thought he was lucky enough to win the bid for the first NFT on the website and paid 100 ETH (about $336K) for this.<br><br>According to a BBC report, a hacker exploited a security hole in the artist Banksy's website and set up a web page (banksy.co.uk/NFT) to sell NFT tokens. In the end, although the hacker returned the money, the user still lost $5,000 in transaction fees.</p>",
