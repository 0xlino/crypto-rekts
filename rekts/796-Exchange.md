"According to the explanation, hackers had compromised areas of the exchange in the previous days, which had caused a user “to mention the current address has been tampered with, coupled with hackers deliberately [using] a similar address with the original withdrawals address to confuse users…”  
  
The hacker exploited vulnerabilities in the exchange to tamper with the withdrawal address of a customer. The customer legitimately requested the withdrawal and failed to notice the changed address. “796” has handled this well, and the situation was quickly made right. No other customers appear to have been affected.
