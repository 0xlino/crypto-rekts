The mechanism of this exploit was described in detail by the Bitrue exchange:<br>https://twitter.com/BitrueOfficial/status/1123992201015509002<br><br>The attacker claimed to have sent 330,000 XRP, but actually transferred only 0.003255 XRP marked as a partial payment \"tfPartialPayment\".<br><br>According to XRPScan, the attacker sent a lot of payments to the BitoPro wallet address, the value of which did not exceed 0.003255 XRP on average.
