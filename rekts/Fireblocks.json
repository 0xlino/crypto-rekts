Cryptocurrency company StakeHound has filed a lawsuit against &nbsp;Fireblocks, claiming that it lost NIS 245.5 million (approximately $75 million) worth of cryptocurrencies it was entrusted with. StakeHound claims that Fireblocks, a developer of secure cross-enterprise asset transfer infrastructure, was negligent and as a result, the funds have been lost and can not be recovered. Fireblocks has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that: \"The keys were generated by the client and stored outside the Fireblocks platform,\" and that \"the customer did not store the backup with a third-party service provider per our guidelines.\"</p>",
