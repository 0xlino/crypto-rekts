Initially, the deployer transferred 500,000,000 $SVC tokens to a distinct address that subsequently added the tokens to the PancakeSwap pool. After a day, this liquidity was removed and the pool was drained entirely by the scammer, allowing them to gain a profit of 131,133 $USD in $BNB. The stolen funds currently reside in the scammer's address. Please note, Securedverse is a clone project and should not be confused with the original.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Deployer Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x525f1fbfe84cd30330ac912bade98743f1b22ae2</p><p><br></p><p>Scammer Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x82e7B460744d66C29B46b184ddf091FA64a9CC1f</p><p><br></p><p>Token Transfer Transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xbe9cf5fdf27e6e251c0a8c61609561e432e96a5fd3f8220fadf3e321d5d2f508</p><p><br></p><p>Liquidity Removal Transaction Example:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xae5a2ad124a2e132b98b7211742deacc401b1e067abf4ec00547f4834126b3bb</p>",
