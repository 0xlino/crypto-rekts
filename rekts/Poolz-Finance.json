The hacker exploited overflow vulnerability to receive assets from the project's vault contract.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>Poolz Finance is a launchpad running on Binance and Polygon chains. The project was exploited via overflow vulnerability. The LockedDeal vault contract of the platform was exploited, which caused the $POOLZ token price to drop by more than 95%. The attacker was able to receive various tokens, after draining the vault contract, and exchanged them for 443,439 $USD worth of $BNB. All the stolen funds remain at the attacker's original address at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x190cd736f5825ff0ae0141b5c9cb7fcd042cef2a</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x058bae36467a9fc5e1045dbdffc2fd65b91c2203#code</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4635d5c63cc02a960c8a4e552099e825b229d169c931bd3697a9f2e28aec45ff</p>",
