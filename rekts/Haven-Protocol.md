 **Details of the Exploit**

Haven Protocol, a privacy-centric DeFi protocol based on Monero, was subjected to three major attacks in late June. The first two attacks on June 24 resulted in the minting of 203,000 xUSD and 13.5 xBTC. On June 27, a vulnerability in the conversion verification of xAsset allowed an unknown amount of XHV to be minted. The final attack on June 29 exploited a vulnerability that enabled the minting of 9 million xUSD. In response to these attacks, the chain initiated a rollback and implemented a hard fork to fix the known vulnerabilities in protocol minting.
