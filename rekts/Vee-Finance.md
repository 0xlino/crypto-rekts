**Quick Summary**

A malicious smart contract was deployed to interact with one of the protocol smart contracts, leading to the withdrawal of funds.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The attacker deployed a smart contract with malicious logic that interacted with one of the protocol smart contracts. Both contracts are unverified. The funds were then withdrawn through a series of transactions. The stolen WBTC and WETH were bridged to Ethereum and are still held on the attacker's address.
