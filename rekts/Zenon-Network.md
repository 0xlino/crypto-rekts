The Zenon Network hack was made possible by an unprotected burn function within the smart contract. Zenon Network left external access to the _burn_ () function:

The attacker deposited tokens in the protocolâ€™s pool for wrapped ZNN (wZNN) tokens and then called the burn function to destroy over 26k wZNN tokens. This decreased the supply of wZNN tokens, increasing their value dramatically.  As a result, when the attacker redeemed his wZNN tokens, the pool believed that he was owed a massive number of WBNB tokens, enabling him to drain the pool. Stolen funds were deposited into the Tornado Cash mixer.
