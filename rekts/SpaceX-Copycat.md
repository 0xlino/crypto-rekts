**Quick Summary**

SpaceX token's deployer rugpulled the project, draining the liquidity pool worth 21,516 $USD and bridged stolen funds to BSC.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

SpaceX is an imitation ERC20 token, unrelated to any legitimate projects sharing its name and symbol. The deployer siphoned off the liquidity in UniSwap by selling SpaceX tokens for 13.16 $ETH across two transactions. The drained funds were subsequently bridged over to the Binance Smart Chain through Multichain Bridge.
