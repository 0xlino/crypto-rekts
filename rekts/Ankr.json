    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>Ankr protocol was exploited by private key compromisation. The attacker replaced contract implementation and was able to mint aBNBc tokens infinitely.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>Ankr is a decentralized infrastructure with a rich ecosystem. The staking contract of the protocol on the Binance Smart Chain was exploited using access control vulnerability. The attacker replaced the implementation for the staking proxy with an unverified malicious contract. Consequently, the malicious contract was used to mint 10,000,000,000,000 $aBNBc which were exchanged for 5,500 $BNB and 5,340,000 $USDC. $aBNBc token price dropped nearly 99% and almost all the liquidity was drained from PancakeSwap and ApeSwap pools. The stolen amount almost completely was transferred through TornadoCash, AnySwap, and CelerBridge. There is just 100 $BNB left in the attacker's original address at the moment.</p><p>At this moment proxy implementation was replaced with the new unverified one.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xf3a465C9fA6663fF50794C698F600Faa4b05c777</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x61e0f3f0dc5cc84f0547799ebb19515ce5f5d20c0b57442135263bcb1b506812</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xcbc5ff4a6c9a66274f9bde424777c3dc862ab576e282fbea3c9c2609ca3e282b</p><p><br></p>",
