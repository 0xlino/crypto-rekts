The transaction, which called the <u>kill</u> method of <u>WalletLibrary</u> with 0xae7168deb525862f4fee37d987a971b385b96952 as the beneficiary address:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47f7cff7a5e671884629c93b368cb18f58a993f4b19c2a53a8662e3f1482f690<br><br>Approximately 30 minutes later, Devops199 created Parity issue #6995 to document what had just occurred:<br>https://github.com/openethereum/parity-ethereum/issues/6995<br><br>Devops199 posted a link to the issue in the Parity gitter channel, asking \u201cIs this serious issue?\u201d He then followed up by asking \u201cWill I get arrested for this?\u201d. It seemed as though Devops199 failed to understand the consequences of what he had done, by stating \u201cI\u2019m eth newbie..just learning\u201d.</p><p><br>About three hours later, Parity released a warning on Twitter:<br>https://twitter.com/ParityTech/status/927850992145719296</p>",
