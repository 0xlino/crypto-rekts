    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>Parity multisig wallet has been attacked by a hacker in two transactions, taking profit of $34M.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The attacker had drained 153,037 ETH from three high-profile multi-signature contracts used to store funds from past token sales. The attacker's address:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32<br><br>The attacker sent two transactions to each of the affected contracts: the first to obtain exclusive ownership of the MultiSig, and the second to move all of its funds.<br><br>1st transaction (call to <u>initWallet</u>):<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9dbf0326a03a2a3719c27be4fa69aacc9857fd231a8d9dcaede4bb083def75ec<br><br>2nd transaction:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xeef10fc5170f669b86c4cd0444882a96087221325f8bf2f55d6188633aa7be7c<br><br>This function was probably created as a way to extract the wallet\u2019s constructor logic into a separate library. The wallet contract forwards all unmatched function calls to the library using <u>delegatecall</u><br><br>This causes all public functions from the library to be callable by anyone, including <u>initWallet</u>, which can change the contract\u2019s owners. Unfortunately, <u>initWallet</u> has no checks to prevent an attacker from calling it after the contract was initialized. The attacker exploited this and simply changed the contract\u2019s <u>m_owners</u> state variable to a list containing only their address, and requiring just one confirmation to execute any transaction:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9dbf0326a03a2a3719c27be4fa69aacc9857fd231a8d9dcaede4bb083def75ec<br><br>After that, the attacker executed the function to send all funds to an account controlled by the attacker:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xeef10fc5170f669b86c4cd0444882a96087221325f8bf2f55d6188633aa7be7c</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32</p><p><br></p>",
