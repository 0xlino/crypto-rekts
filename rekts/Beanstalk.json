Proposal #18 takes the whole contract\u2019s value, while Proposal #19 transfers $250k to the Ukraine donation address. BIP18 is the name of this Ukraine proposal (instead of BIP19)<br><br>BIP18 proposal transaction:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3cb358d40647e178ee5be25c2e16726b90ff2c17d34b64e013d8cf1c2c358967<br><br>The attacker\u2019s contract that was used to perform a flash loan:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0x1c5dcdd006ea78a7e4783f9e6021c32935a10fb4<br><br>The transaction behind the flash loan:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcd314668aaa9bbfebaf1a0bd2b6553d01dd58899c508d4729fa7311dc5d33ad7<br><br>The flash loan was used to get:<br>- 350m DAI, 500m USDC and 150m USDT from Aave;<br>- 32m BEAN from Uniswap;<br>- 11.6M LUSD from SushiSwap.<br><br>These tokens were used to supplement the liquidity in Curve pools with BEAN for governance voting.<br><br>At first, the attacker minted 3CRV using DAI, USDC, and USDT. After, he generated the token BEAN3CRV-f using BEANS. This was followed by a deposit of 32 million $BEAN tokens and 25 million $LUSD into yet another contract to create a new token named BEAN3LUSD-f.<br><br>BEAN3CRV-f and BEAN3LUSD-f may be transformed straight into Seeds (a special type of asset called which acts like voting power in the system), providing the attacker with sufficient voting power. In reality, the attacker was able to manage more than 70% of the total number of Seeds thanks to the flash loan and $BEAN<br><br>The BIP18 triggers the execution of the designed code with the governance privilege to drain the pool fund:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x68cdec0ac76454c3b0f7af0b8a3895db00adf6daaf3b50a99716858c4fa54c<br><br>During the attack transaction, 250,000 USDC was donated to the Ukraine Crypto Donation address.<br><br>$181 million was drained from Beanstalk, but the attacker only kept $76M, which were swapped on Ether and deposited into Tornado Cash mixer in a bunch of transactions:<br>https://bloxy.info/txs/transfers_from/0x1c5dcdd006ea78a7e4783f9e6021c32935a10fb4?currency_id=1</p>",
