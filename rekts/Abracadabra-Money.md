 **Details of the Exploit**

Abracadabra.Money is a decentralized protocol providing staking, lending, and borrowing opportunities. The protocol's lending pool was exploited via the oracle issue. Temporarily depegging of $MIM stablecoin allowed the attacker to withdraw 110,911 $MIM tokens at nearly zero cost using a deployed smart contract with unverified source code. All the stolen funds were transferred through Tornado Cash.
