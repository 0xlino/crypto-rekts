This allowed the exploit contract to use those LP tokens as collateral for borrowing crypto assets from Cheese Bank<br><br>- raised the CHEESE price at UniswapV2 by swapping 20k ETH to 288k CHEESE, making the UNI_V2 LP tokens more valuable as collaterals Cheese Bank. This is the crucial step in this incident since the Cheese Bank uses the amount of WETH in a liquidity pool to estimate the price of the corresponding LP token. The manipulated UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH pool (with 20k+ WETH) allowed the attacker to drain all the USDC, USDT, and DAI withheld by Cheese Bank by legit <u>borrow</u>() calls<br><br>- refreshed the price feeds of Cheese Bank. The attacker intentionally invoked the <u>CheesePriceOracle::refresh</u>() function to refresh the price of the UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH LP token which is derived from the amount of WETH in the liquidity pool and the ETH price derived from the UNI_V2-USDT-ETH pool. Specifically, the <u>CheesePriceOracle::fetchLPAnhorPrice</u>() function gets the <u>wEthBalance</u> of UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH contract. With the passed in <u>ethPrice</u>, the <u>totalValue</u> is derived by<u>&nbsp;wEthBalance x 2 x ethPrice</u>. Therefore, the unit price of the UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH LP token is computed by <u>totalValue / totalSupply of LP tokens</u>. It means if the attacker could somehow increase the amount of WETH in a pool (e.g., <u>addLiquidity</u>() with flash loan ether), the price of the LP token would be increased<br><br>- drained the USDC, USDT, DAI withheld by Cheese Bank by <u>borrow</u>() calls. Besides the 2M USDC, 1.23M USDT and 87k DAI are borrowed from Cheese Bank. The exact balance of USDC/USDT/DAI is borrowed by the exploit contract<br><br>- swapped 288k CHEESE back to 19.98k ETH at UniswapV2<br><br>- swapped 58k USDC to 132 ETH at UniswapV2<br><br>- collected assets into https://etherscan.io/address/02b7165d0916e373f0235056a7e6fccdb82d2255<br><br>- repaid 21k ETH flashloan to dYdX.</p>",
