The bots identified a significant price difference in the ETH prices on the platform and took advantage of the liquidity. This price discrepancy was due to the highly volatile ETH/USDT trading pair price, which was broadcasted by the Bitfinex API at approximately 02:45 AM AEST time. Meanwhile, Binance disrupted the system by blocking the US-related IP used by Mycelium, which prevented the system from rebalancing the price independently.</p><p><br></p>",
