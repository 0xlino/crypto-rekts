The hacker profited for 24483 $USD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>PlantWorld is BEP20 token trading on PancakeSwap and can't be confused with other tokens with the same PLTD symbol. The attacker took 666,000 $BUSD as a flash loan and bought 1,570,000 $PLTD tokens using a smart contract with an unverified source code. Consequently, $PLTD tokens were used to manipulate inner variables and a large amount of additional $PLTD was used to drain the liquidity from the Pancake pool. The attacker was able to withdraw 690,000 $BUSD and profited for 24,483 $BUSD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x6ded5927f2408a8d115da389b3fe538990e93c5b</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x83797825f6020a443b95fa3932ab13dd61d48b49</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x8385625e9d8011f4ad5d023d64dc7985f0315b6a4be37424c7212fe4c10dafe0</p>",
