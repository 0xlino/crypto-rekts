The token's creator retweeted another Twitter account that had been compromised. The users were sent to a phishing site and got their funds drained by the exploiter. Various assets including $PSYOP, $BEN, $WETH, and $UNI were transferred to the malicious address and consequently swapped to $ETH. The stolen funds were distributed between multiple EOA addresses. The total stolen amount reached 122,549 $USD. The creator of the PSYOP project promised to compensate the full amount to affected users.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xFB2E132751628025D94a17245288364cd62532D0</p><p><br></p><p>Funds transfer transactions:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd70aa38c4ff877aa37d994c3702a1202b5efcc281454c6248df7f1514a54d7e3<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x991004f6db5013843c18e653644dbb0b8e2f6056f092d8200c478f4ac28fec0e<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb67274ff40bbadc5009980705e37ff6153e3eba75a3191954a95a0589cf199ee</p>",
