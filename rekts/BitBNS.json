BitBNS attempted to cover up the hack by tweeting about \"system maintenance in progress\" instead of disclosing the breach to users. BitBNS CEO Guarav Dahake later admitted to hiding the hack from customers at the advice of law enforcement. However, some funds were ultimately recovered thanks to cooperation from other exchanges and law enforcement.</p>",
