The scammer stole 374,723 $USD while only initially adding 10,000 $USD as liquidity.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>Linda Yaccarino $LINDA token is a BEP20 token trading on PancakeSwap. The project experienced a significant rugpull in which the deployer manipulated the price and created false on-chain activity. They repeatedly bought and sold tokens for the same amount to give an illusion of trading volume. Additionally, three transactions involving 600,000 $USD were executed to pump up prices further.</p><p>The scammer then withdrew 374,723 $USD by selling all their acquired $LINDA tokens, leaving investors with worthless holdings. The scammer used a smart contract that allows anyone to create scam tokens.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Scammer Address:&nbsp;</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xbcf9b9515251e37626bf0351ecb65dee86048faa</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transactions:&nbsp;</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/f3f2fc714bc66fca7a50d7a9be36dffc8e55d84c9035f280496a5a12850465fa</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/8fe809142909908d6b1716f6367a45cab49a059f04b9927a7c400376fe0026a0</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/cf7b6ec7d7f43732475753506745a8db3690f233bb44bbb642afb4acfc5b051d</p><p><br></p><p>Withdrawal Transaction:&nbsp;</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/85aff0544fd4b64b5f4917b10c050a1b194634f4dfe5236429c2c0aa1a9b8ff4</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Contract:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x5f11614A956D320EB7e6dc8Bd3A83689C2ed56Af</p>",
