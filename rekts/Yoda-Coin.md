**Quick Summary**

Yoda Coin project rugpulled by the creator who removed all liquidity from UniSwap pool and transferred roughly 114,000 $USD to FixedFloat.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Yoda Coin is an ERC20 token trading on UniSwap. The project experienced a significant drop in price, which turned out to be a rugpull orchestrated by its own creator. The scammer raised 60 $ETH which is worth 114,000 $USD during pre-sale but only added 29 $ETH to LP. Furthermore, multiple $YODA tokens were created with different addresses.

The attacker then removed all available LP funds and migrated them to another contract address while deleting social accounts/groups related to YodaCoin on various platforms.
