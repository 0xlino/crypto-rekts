**Quick Summary**

Safe Wallet (formerly Gnosis Safe) on Ethereum was exploited due to an approval-related issue, resulting in a loss of 283,828 $USD from the user's wallet in various tokens.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Between August 12 and August 13, 2023, Safe Wallet, a DeFi wallet on the Ethereum chain, was exploited by three attackers in three separate transactions. The attackers discovered an approval-related flaw that allowed them to steal various tokens including WBTC, PEPE, USDT, WETH, and CRV.

The total loss from these exploits amounts to approximately 283,828 $USD.
