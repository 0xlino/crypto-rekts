By using flash loans as collateral, they were able to layer multiple borrow functions within one another to increase the borrowed amount before the protocol could update the debt balance. This approach was repeated and resulted in the borrowing of assets that were significantly more valuable than the collateral provided.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>The attacker's address:</p><p>https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xD041Ad9aaE5Cf96b21c3ffcB303a0Cb80779E358/transactions</p><p>The stolen funds were bridged to Ethereum and deposited into Tornado Cash mixer:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xd041ad9aae5cf96b21c3ffcb303a0cb80779e358</p>",
