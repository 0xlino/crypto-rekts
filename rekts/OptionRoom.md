OptionRoom has been affected due to the ChainSwap hack.  
  
"As such, we had no other way to withdraw and secure the community liquidity other than by selling into the pool. This enabled us to mitigate the financial damages of the hack, reducing a potential $800,000 loss into a $38,000 loss. All the funds recovered from the emergency actions we took were added back as liquidity on PancakeSwap, and all liquidity providers were recompensed directly to their wallets."
