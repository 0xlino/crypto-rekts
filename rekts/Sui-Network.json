The deployer sent 1 billion $SUI tokens to the scammer who added initial liquidity and later drained it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>Sui Network is not related to the original SUI token. On October 22nd, 2022, the deployer transferred 1 billion $SUI tokens to a scammer's address. The scammer used these tokens along with 20 $BNB to add liquidity to the PancakeSwap pool. On May 22nd, 2023, after waiting for several months without any activity or trading volume on this fake token project; the scammer removed all available LP funds worth around $196k USD by draining them from the PancakeSwap pool and transferred them into another EOA address. Currently, there is only about $300 USD worth of $BNB remaining as liquidity in that pool.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Scammer Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x333ec34ecd77ba2fdcfc5a4d6ba71aed245e8764</p><p><br></p><p>Deployer Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x54bCf365c27e7CCdC22403fB1A368ACB7541Fe19</p><p><br></p><p>Funds Holder Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x5e33f620f42770c828904268d70b27d8b5cddc3b</p><p><br></p><p>Liquidity Removal Transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xfb1f1fdc149a63ae3b5cec9f744a5aececeeed632b75a815e5af2b666d3e3850</p><p><br></p><p>Deployer Relation Proof:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/a7632b84d35d4d99133ae0a9b59f8b48af77c92666be4e3fde0b0ece134b6dc3</p>",
