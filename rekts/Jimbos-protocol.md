**Quick Summary**

Jimbos Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity protocol on the Arbitrum system, was hacked on May 28, resulting in a loss of 4,000 Ether (ETH) worth approximately $7.5 million.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The attack on Jimbos Protocol exploited the lack of slippage control on liquidity conversions, allowing the attacker to reverse swap orders and benefit from the price discrepancy. The protocol's mechanism, designed to address liquidity and volatile token prices, had a logical vulnerability that enabled the exploit. As a result, the price of the native token, Jimbo (JIMBO), dropped by 40%. The attackers extracted 4,090 ETH from the Arbitrum network and used the Stargate bridge and the Celer Network to transfer around 4,048 ETH from the Ethereum network.
