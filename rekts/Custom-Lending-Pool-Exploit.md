**Quick Summary**

Custom lending pool on Binance Smart Chain exploited due to approval issue, resulting in a loss of 366,058 USDT.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

A custom lending pool running on the Binance Smart Chain was exploited on November 12, 2023, due to an approval issue in the smart contract. The attacker was able to drain approved funds from the victim contract, totaling 366,058 USDT. The exact cause of the exploit is hard to define, as the contract is not verified and the source code is not available. The stolen funds were bridged to the Ethereum mainnet via Stargate Bridge and swapped for DAI and WETH. These funds were then deposited into Railgun Relay, a private wallet on the Ethereum network.
