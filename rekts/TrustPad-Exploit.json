On November 7, 2023, the project's vulnerable smart contracts were exploited by an attacker. The vulnerability was in the staking mechanism, allowing the attacker to perform multiple deposit and withdraw transactions to exploit and withdraw roughly 615.19 BNB. The stolen funds were then deposited into TornadoCash, making it difficult to trace the attacker's identity. The exploit resulted in a loss of approximately 152,487 USD worth of BNB.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x1a7b15354e2F6564fcf6960c79542DE251cE0dC9</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x191a34e6c0780c3d1ab5c9bc04948e231d742b7d88e0e4f85568d57fcdc03182</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Contract Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x1694d7fAbf3B28f11D65DEEb9f60810DAa26909a</p><p><br></p><p>TornadoCash Deposit Transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xfe5543cea4e6d2e85e97de054ab92e0e3433acb49b04f53157f0ea10c0734eee</p>",
