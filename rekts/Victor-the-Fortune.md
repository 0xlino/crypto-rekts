**Quick Summary**

Victor the Fortune was exploited using smart contract vulnerability. The hacker was able to mint $VTF tokens and made a profit of 58,450 $USD by selling them.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Victor the Fortune is a BEP20 token trading on P2ESwap. The project was exploited via minting vulnerability. The hacker deployed a malicious smart contract with unverified source code to take a 100,000 $BUSD flash loan and bought $VTF tokens. Consequently, the malicious smart contract minted $VTF tokens to multiple newly deployed contracts and sold the tokens on P2ESwap. In the same transaction flash loan was paid back leaving a profit of 58,450 $BUSD to the attacker. The price of the $VTF token dropped by more than 98% at the moment.
