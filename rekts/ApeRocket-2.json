Got the majority share (99%) of the vault<br><br>- deposited 15M LP from the MiniApeV2 contract of ApeSwap to the DAI-MATIC LP vault of ApeRocket<br><br>- called <u>withdrawAll</u>() on the vault<br><br>- with the rather large amount of LP token added (deposited from ApeSwap\u2019s MasterChef) by the attacker at step 3, it returned a large amount of profit. As a result, the system minted 2.5M pSAPCE as a reward to the attacker<br><br>- swapped the rewarded pSPACE token to ETH, repaid the flash loan<br><br>- taken out 521 ETH.<br><br>The <u>deposit</u>() function of ApeSwap Polygon's MiniApeV2 (a fork of SushiSwap's MiniChefV2) allows deposits to any address, which is not possible for a regular MasterChef v1, allowing the profit amount for everyone in the vault to be increased.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if the attacker owns the bulk of the vault, virtually all of the profit will be returned to the attacker.</p>",
