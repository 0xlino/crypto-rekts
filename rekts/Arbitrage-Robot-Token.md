**Quick Summary**

The Arbitrage Robot Token project's token $RBTR price dropped by over 96% after the Staking contract was exploited.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Arbitrage Robot Token is a platform that provides arbitrage opportunities. The project's Staking contract was hacked because of security issues after a week of deployment. The attacker used a couple of deployed smart contracts with unverified source codes in order to drain all $RBTR tokens in the staking contract. After stealing the funds, the attacker sold 10,088,644 $RBTR tokens for 472,459 $USD on PancakeSwap which dumped the token price by more than 96%.
