Digital currency exchange BTER announced that it has lost 7,170 bitcoins, or roughly $1.75 million at press time, in an apparent hack on its cold wallet system.  
  
In a statement posted to the China-based exchange's website, the company said that it had shut down its platform in the wake of the attack and that withdrawals for user balances "will be arranged later".  
  
A separate post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo from BTER claimed that it was working with law enforcement officials on the matter.  
  
The stolen funds were broadcast through the transaction below, according to the announcement, and the bitcoins appear to have been split into a number of separate wallets since the alleged intrusion:
