 **Details of the Exploit**

LooBr, a cross-chain social-media NFT-Marketplace, was exploited by its deployer who removed liquidity from the LP pool in two separate transactions over a three-day period. Interestingly, the deployer utilized two different tokens carrying the same name during this operation. After the liquidity removal, the funds were transferred through a couple of EOA addresses before being deposited into the Binance Exchange. It is worth noting that a Meta Ruffy Deployer address was also involved in this incident. The total financial loss from this rugpull is calculated to be 147,439 $USD worth of 614 BNB.
