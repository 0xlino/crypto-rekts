To connect the liquidity between ERC20 and BSC, RAI Finance has been using Chainswap to ensure the liquidity between both blockchains.  
  
RAI Finance reserved 2.9M RAIs to an address 0x9D4D377cFd6466Fe03e3cCbB266DC0ac235CcDe3, and this address automatically approves the spent access to the Chainswap’s bridge contract.  
  
The Chainswap smart contract for RAI spend access has been exploited on Jul-03–2021 12:39:18 AM +UTC, from the contract address 0x0e128fb9f266f0cfedeb3b789f6fd4af50d51b84 which has access up to 2.9M RAIs in total at the account.
