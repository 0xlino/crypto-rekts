    "description": "<p>Hackers launched a phishing attack targeting users of the Ledger hardware wallet.<br><br>The attackers allegedly sent Ledger users an email informing them that their wallets had been hacked in a security breach impacting thousands of users. They stated that the incident occurred on October 24 and that the Ledger security team is unable to estimate the extent of user harm.<br><br>\"In order to protect your assets, please download the latest version of Ledger Live and follow the instructions to set up a new PIN to your wallet,\" the email said. The user is then sent to a download link on a bogus website designed to steal the user's credentials.</p>",
