The root of the issue:  
The _makeHop()_ function allowed shareholders to shift their funds through different staking pools in a gas-efficient manner. This feature was intended to be implemented on the next dApp update, however, itâ€™s been around for about 1 month on the contract side.  
  
The issue is in the line below, which assumes that there can not be a malicious smart contract on the pool that is called on _receiveHop_ (_pool):  
  
tokenPool.stakingToken.approve(address(_newPool),  
tokenPool.stakingToken.totalSupply());  
  
By approving the totalSupply to the new pool, Contract B was able to have allowance to spend the staking contract tokens. This basically means they were able to withdraw them from the staking contract at a whim once that initial setup was made.  
  
The attacker:  
\- created contract A

\- created contract B

\- the attacker contract then proceeded to buy some EarnHub, stake it, and make it hop to contract B (makeHop(contractBaddress))

\- after receiving the hop, the contract was able to drain the funds from the staking contract by just using the _transferFrom_ () function repeated times.
