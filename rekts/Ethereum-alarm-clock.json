They essentially called cancel functions on their contracts with inflated transaction fees, and a bug in the smart contract refunded them a greater value of gas fees than they initially paid, allowing them to pocket the difference. This has resulted in the theft of $260K in gas fees so far.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Etherscan transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4a84d0872887f91546cd5400cf99763b654975efb3376ee55e4463bcfbca4e97</p>",
