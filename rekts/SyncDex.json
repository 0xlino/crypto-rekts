The scammer stole around 442,470 $USD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The SyncDex Finance project showed several red flags even before it was rugpulled. Comments were muted on Twitter, and words were added to ban lists on Telegram/Discord channels to prevent concerns about the project from being raised. Moreover, their contract did not allow for withdrawing pledged funds, which is always a warning sign.</p><p>The staking pool allowed only admins to withdraw funds while users' assets remained locked up permanently.</p><p>Eventually, the deployer pulled out around 442,470 $USD worth of liquidity and vanished into thin air. The official Twitter and website of the project went shut down.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Scammer Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x5aA713AEDe567e223A9502cC070FADEAc47fE194</p><p><br></p><p>Funds currently on addresses below:</p><p>https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0xE4eDb277e41dc89aB076a1F049f4a3EfA700bCE8</p><p>https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x80C67432656d59144cEFf962E8fAF8926599bCF8</p>",
