**Quick Summary**

Some users of the multi-chain wallet BitKeep had downloaded a hacked APK version. This allowed the hackers to start draining their addresses. Current losses reached $8M.

 

 **Details of the Exploit**

Users that were using the hacked version 7.2.9 of the BitKeep’s APK have been losing their funds.

 The APK has been hacked due to a vulnerability in the API server used by the wallet app. This allowed the attacker to access the app’s database, which held critical user information such as private keys of their wallets.

Funds have been stolen on BSC, Ethereum, TRON and Polygon.
