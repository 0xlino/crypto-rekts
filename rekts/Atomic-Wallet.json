The wallet was breached and approximately $115 million worth of various tokens were stolen from their users via access control. The stolen tokens included Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), Binance Coin(BNB), and Polygon(MATIC). Tron-based USDT seemed to be the largest stolen stash according to on-chain analytics with the stolen amount of 7,950,000 $USDT. The stolen funds mostly were swapped for native coins as $ETH and held in multiple EOA addresses.</p><p>The impacted users represented less than 1% of their monthly active users, according to AtomicWallet's official tweet, but worth mentioning that only the top five users were lost roughly 17,000,000 $USD in total. Several users reported that their crypto was stolen after a recent software update while others said they were impacted despite not updating to the latest version as per messages from Atomic Wallet\u2019s official Telegram channel. Victims have been asked to submit information through a Google Docs form that Atomic Wallet is using for its investigations.</p><p>With the help of on-chain experts, 1,200,000 $USD worth of funds were rescued from the hackers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker Address Example:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x26208699df4896f09b83993e7c8baad647421b21</p><p>https://tronscan.org/#/address/TV92VkrHpim1MN58GNC5RfUWVUmNTPRwGA</p><p><br></p><p>Affected Address Example:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x8568ab3AF2E3A1cF3c93dFbCe0D8A3CEE1AcB3dd</p><p><br></p><p>Involved Addresses list:<br>https://www.chainabuse.com/report/b181be45-51a7-446b-83ae-8408c9103bb5</p>",
