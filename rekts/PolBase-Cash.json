The staking contracts were unverified, meaning the code was not visible on the block explorer for everyone to review.</p><p>The contract deployer interacted with these 4 smart contracts using function <u>setOperation</u>() with the below address as input data:<br>0x5C0D86B9c5de0b2b88895a6Cb0441a0Cdd5d52eA.<br>This address received permission to withdraw funds from the staking smart contracts.
