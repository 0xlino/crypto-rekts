The firm previously declared on its website that it had filed for creditor protection, but the document itself reveals further information about its plight.<br><br>According to the petition, there were around 115,000 individuals with balances signed up on the exchange as of January 31, 2019, with $70 million CAD in fiat and $180 million CAD in crypto owing altogether.<br><br>Cotten reportedly died of Crohn\u2019s disease in Jaipur, India in early December 2018. The exchange announced his death earlier this month. A death certificate was included in the list of exhibits.
