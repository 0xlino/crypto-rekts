**Quick Summary**

UniverseToken was exploited via access control vulnerability. 1,447,175 $USD worth of assets were stolen and transferred through TornadoCash.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

UniverseToken is a DEX on the Binance chain. The project's contract was exploited via access control vulnerability.  The $UVT token price dropped by 99% after an incident. The attacker was able to exploit the controller contract with unverified source code and withdraw roughly 100,000,000 $UVT tokens. Consequently, the tokens were swapped for 5011 $BNB and transferred to the EOA address. All the stolen amount was transferred through TornadoCash.
