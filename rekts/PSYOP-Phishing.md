**Quick Summary**

PSYOP's users were affected by a phishing attack, and the exploiters stole 122,549 $USD worth of assets.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

PSYOP is a BEP20 token trading on UniSwap. The token's creator retweeted another Twitter account that had been compromised. The users were sent to a phishing site and got their funds drained by the exploiter. Various assets including $PSYOP, $BEN, $WETH, and $UNI were transferred to the malicious address and consequently swapped to $ETH. The stolen funds were distributed between multiple EOA addresses. The total stolen amount reached 122,549 $USD. The creator of the PSYOP project promised to compensate the full amount to affected users.
