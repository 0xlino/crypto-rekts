**Quick Summary**

Float Protocol's pool was exploited via Oracle Manipulation which led to a loss of 1,440,724 $USD. 

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Float Protocol is a staking and earning platform running on the Ethereum chain. The protocol's Rari 90 pool was exploited via Oracle Manipulation, which allowed the attacker to gain 1,440,724 $USD worth of assets including $FRAX, $FEI, and $DAI. The attack started with 47 $ETH withdrawn from TornadoCash and then used to buy $FLOAT tokens from the UniV3 pool. The action led to the $FLOAT price being higher than usual, and then Rari 90 pool that uses UniV3 pool as an oracle was exploited. The exploiter returned 250,000 $USDC to the protocol's multisig wallet. The rest of the stolen funds were transferred through TornadoCash.
