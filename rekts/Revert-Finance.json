The project's V3Utils contract that was deployed on 3 February 2023 was exploited, allowing the attacker to drain user funds. The total stolen amount is nearly 30,000 $USD, where the majority is 22,983 $USDC. All the lost funds were compensated to the affected users as airdrops.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x38f887a0fe01b9e4960d5c727519408fa7f32f70</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xd346f652a56d149d585b5447851928f42f61fb27</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdaccbc437cb07427394704fbcc8366589ffccf974ec6524f3483844b043f31d5</p>",
