**Quick Summary**

LPC token experienced an exploit that resulted in the loss of 45,304 $USD of liquidity from its pool.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

LPC is a BEP20 token trading on PancakeSwap. On 25 July 2022, the project was exploited by an attacker who took advantage of a contract vulnerability and drained 45,304 $USD from its liquidity pool. The malicious actor exploited token contract vulnerabilty that allowed the transfer transactions to multiply the token amount and gain new $LPC tokens for nothing. As a result, there was significant slippage on LPC with over 99% drop in price. All the stolen funds were transferred through TornadoCash.
