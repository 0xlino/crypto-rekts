**Quick Summary**

Hackers exploit smart contract vulnerability in crowdfunding platform DAO Maker, stealing approximately $7 million in USD Coin (USDC) from over 5,000 user accounts.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The hackers exploited a smart contract vulnerability in DAO Maker, a platform aimed at raising funds for crypto projects. They initially stole 10,000 USDC and then made 15 more transactions to acquire additional funds, totaling approximately $7 million. The attack affected 5,251 user accounts. According to DAO Maker CEO Christoph Zaknun, the Strong Holder Offering (SHO) contract was targeted because the number of deposits exceeded their expectations. Users with up to $900 in their accounts were reportedly unaffected as the platform moved their funds into different wallets. DAO Maker has suspended all deposits pending a full Root Cause Analysis. Blockchain intelligence firm CipherBlade is conducting an investigation into the hack and has identified a Binance account associated with the attacker. DAO Maker is exploring compensation options for all affected users.
