The assets locked up in the Multichain MPC address were moved abnormally to an EOA address. The unexpected outflows led to Multichain\u2019s Fantom Bridge losing its entire holdings in wBTC, USDC, USDT, and a handful of altcoins, worth over $130 million in total. Similar outflows were observed from Multichain\u2019s Moonriver and Dogecoin bridge contracts. The assets transferred out of the Multichain Fantom bridge include DAI, LINK, USDT, wBTC, wETH, and USDC. Multichain team announced the team is not sure what happened. The most possible cause of the exploit is wallet compromise, but there is also the possibility of an insider hack.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Suspicious Addresses:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x418ed2554c010a0c63024d1da3a93b4dc26e5bb7</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x027f1571aca57354223276722dc7b572a5b05cd8</p><p><br></p><p>Funds Moving Transactions:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xda80a8c8d5a8fdf0208a6fd01c39af018e400763b1d08f3543f52353345fe62e</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbd29fe07555c28527fb0207aa0ac2b67d4afef0426793c35b76d005613477fc4</p>",
