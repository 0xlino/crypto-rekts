Defibox discovered an abnormal exchange situation of the EOS-EMOON trading pair on September 16th. After an emergency investigation, the swap contract was suspended on September 17th, and it was reopened on the morning of September 17th after auditing and multiple signings were completed.  
  
This exchange abnormality is caused by the incompatibility between the Defibox Swap contract and the EMOON contract. Before the event, the number of pots was 482636464535179.88 EMOON/4866.1494 EOS. When the contract was suspended, the EMOON pot was 5790970803030.11 EMOON/3.4553EOS, resulting in about 4863 EOS loss.  
  
The Defibox team has eliminated this type of risk caused by other burning tokens and has upgraded the Swap contract to further improve the security of the contract.
