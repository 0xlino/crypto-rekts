But, this left a couple of hours where users of the wallet attempting to visit the MyEtherWallet.com website were redirected to a \u201cspoof\u201d or phishing site controlled by the hackers.</p><p><br></p><p>The hack employed the \u201cdecade-old\u201d technique of redirecting Domain Name Servers (DNS) rather than a hack, or weakness in, MyEtherWallet.<br><br>It was quickly identified that over 150k worth of ETH had been stolen in the DNS hack with 179 transactions totaling 216.06 ETH sent to:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0x1d50588c0aa11959a5c28831ce3dc5f1d3120d29</p>",
