The project suffered from a Flash Loan Attack and lost roughly 750 $ETH in total. The attacker was able to receive 268 $ETH while the rest of the stolen funds were siphoned by MEV Bot. The attacker deployed a malicious smart contract with unverified source code, and exploited EFLeverVault contract's logic issue. Security check for a callback initiator was missing in the affected contract, which allowed the attacker to drain the vault contract's $ETH. All the stolen funds were transferred through TornadoCash.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xdf31f4c8dc9548eb4c416af26dc396a25fde4d5f</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x160c5950a01b88953648ba90ec0a29b0c5383e055d35a7835d905c53a3dda01e</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x140cca423081ed0366765f18fc9f5ed299699388</p>",
