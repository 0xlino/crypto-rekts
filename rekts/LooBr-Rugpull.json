Interestingly, the deployer utilized two different tokens carrying the same name during this operation. After the liquidity removal, the funds were transferred through a couple of EOA addresses before being deposited into the Binance Exchange. It is worth noting that a Meta Ruffy Deployer address was also involved in this incident. The total financial loss from this rugpull is calculated to be 147,439 $USD worth of 614 BNB.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Deployer Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x79003a1052658f3b664cc080a001875d501be4b1</p><p><br></p><p>Scammers' Addresses:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xfa777ea4f6486c650648e99f7037272ada739aca</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x49273b37ad4bbb7b85c292a540f39e4cac9e6277</p><p><br></p><p>Liquidity Removal Transactions:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xbc8f34ccde9de3ec5db94c9e1293431ac90b06be5675acee5f97616c6695c04d</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x9d25b4eb1f047ed00b783f39f0d0d8832821b4282d23ad81ddb160df227df079</p>",
