**Quick Summary**

On March 30, 2023, the RPL balance of the poap.eth wallet (0xf6B6F07862A02C85628B3A9688beae07fEA9C863) was drained due to a phishing attack.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The attacker used a phishing attack against the owner of the poap.eth wallet and gained a significant allowance in RPL tokens. Two different exploiter addresses then executed the transferFrom() function, resulting in the theft of 21,474 and 64,423 tokens. The RPL tokens were subsequently swapped to ETH and dispersed between a few different wallets.
