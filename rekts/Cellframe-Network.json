    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>Cellframe Network ($CELL) experienced a flash loan exploit on the Binance Smart Chain, resulting in a loss of 76,112 $USD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>CELL is a community BEP20 token of the Cellframe Network, trading on PancakeSwap. On June 1st, 2023, Cellframe Network was exploited via a flash loan attack that caused the price to drop -45%. The attacker successfully obtained a profit of 245.52 $BNB and approximately $76,112 USD. The exploit occurred due to an unverified source code deployed by the attacker in a single transaction.</p><p>The exploiter took out a flashloan from the DPP project and drained funds from PancakeV3Pool. All stolen assets were transferred to another EOA address where they currently remain.</p><p>The source of the problem is a smart contract that migrated old liquidity to new without taking into account changing spread between them during migration.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x2525c811ecf22fc5fcde03c67112d34e97da6079</p><p><br></p><p>Funds Holder Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x8882b31f90f17f94a10e6c2f85dc629a4aaf9e70</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x943c2a5f89bc0c17f3fe1520ec6215ed8c6b897ce7f22f1b207fea3f79ae09a6</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Contract:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x1e2a251b29e84e1d6d762c78a9db5113f5ce7c48</p>",
