Online dogecoin storage provider DogeVault.com has been compromised by hackers, according to an official announcement from the service.  
  
The site shut down as a result of the attack, which also saw the destruction of all of the service’s data. As a result, DogeVault is encouraging users not to transfer any funds to its wallet addresses while the attack is under investigation, and explained:  
“We are currently in the process of identifying the extent of the attack and potential impact on users’ funds. This involves salvaging existing wallet data from an off-site backup.”  
  
DogeVault has indicated that it will issue an additional statement on its findings within 24 to 48 hours of the initial post.  
  
The overall loss of funds sustained by the site is as-yet unknown, though The Cryptocurrency Times has estimated that as many as 111m DOGE (nearly $51,000 at press time) could have been lost in the theft.
