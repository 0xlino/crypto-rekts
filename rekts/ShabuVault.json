He invoked <u>addMinter</u> function in the following transaction:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x58bcb174d2442878adad1bdaddb6ac98e7ce346b5cd9e9b8ed80c1cd06676b14</p><p><br></p><p>After doing this, the owner generated an additional 4K SHABU tokens and placed them in his wallet. The owner could increase the tax rate to 100% and put himself on the whitelist. The project exit scammed after the token contract owner drained liquidity, stealing 10 ETH. ShabuVault's website and social media are inaccessible.</p>",
