The auction site Bitmit had 15 BTC stolen, after the server was accessed by an employee of their hosting company without authorization.  
  
Bitmit, known as the 'eBay of bitcoin', has had a string of setbacks since its inception. After the theft the site has remained online, albeit with the header "Bitmit is going to be sold. Please complete your orders and withdraw your funds asap!"  
  
"We are planning to let another company take over Bitmit. Meanwhile we deactivated the site to let you withdraw your funds & complete your orders. The chances are good that Bitmit will be continued." - Bitmit stated.
