**Quick Summary**

The fake SkyVerse NFT project fraudulently withdrew roughly 150,000 $USD from the users.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

SkyVerse is an NFT collection on the Ethereum chain that offers staking opportunities as well. The project's Twitter account and website were recreated and then 150,000 $USD worth of $ETH was withdrawn from the affected user's wallets. The scammer convinced over 250 NFT collectors that the project had started minting and was rapidly selling out. The scammer used a fake "counter" on the website to make it seem like the NFTs were selling out in real-time
