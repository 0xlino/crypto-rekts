**Quick Summary**

Nirvana Finance became the victim of a flash loan attack during which the liquidity pools of the protocol were depleted. The Solana-based Nirvana protocol suffered losses of $3.5M.

 **  
Details of the Exploit**

Nirvana is a sustainable mechanism of wealth creation due to the growing minimum price. The $ANA and $NIRV token functioned as a balance between profitability and risk.

Nirvana Finance has been subjected to a flash loan attack on the Solana network. The attacker took a flash loan during which he managed to manipulate the price and change the value of $ANA from $8 to $24.27 per transaction. Using the Solend Protocol , the attacker borrowed 10M $USDC which were used for exploiting Nirvana. He minted $ANA in worth of 10M $USDC then swapped $ANA for $USDT taking a profit of $3.5M which then were bridged through the Wormhole Bridge into the Ethereum network. At the moment of this writing all the stolen funds are sitting on the attacker's account.
