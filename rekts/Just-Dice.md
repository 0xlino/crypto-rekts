The owner of the bitcoin betting site Just-Dice, a rival to SatoshiDice, had a severe moment of panic when a user taking advantage of a human error caused him to lose 1,300 bitcoins (around $116,090 at the time of writing).  
  
Known only as ‘dooglus’, the owner revealed on the Bitcoin Talk forum that he had made something of a colossal mistake. What happened was this: a player won a load of bitcoins on the site and asked to withdraw them, dooglus paid out, but forgot to remove the balance from the user’s Just-Dice account. The user then gambled — and lost — the bitcoins that were left in his account and dooglus covered the loss out of his own pocket.  
  
When he realized his mistake, dooglus contacted the user, who claimed he had left his laptop in a café and that someone else logged onto his Just-Dice account and gambled the money.
