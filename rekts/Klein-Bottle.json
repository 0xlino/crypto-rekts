The token creator deployed $KLB token and when the price of it went up the scammer exchanged tokens for $BNB dumping the price of $KLB.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p><em>Klein Bottle's smart contract had never been published by the project deployer, https://bscscan.com/address/0x60930de2669670d1768108a77244f8ef56b4c544#code. This implicates that any investors intending to conduct due diligence and research on the source code would not have encountered any useful information. In simple terms, the project stood only on the grounds of promises made by the team, which could not be checked by investors since the source of code was not available to them</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>The creator of the $KLB token minted 100B $KLB tokens. (https://bscscan.com/tx/0x6d022790ad69a30e3f44022f5ca8da4583052dd541de4d41e0a41f814688d319).</p><p>After the creation of the price asset, 70% of the total supply was sent to this address (https://bscscan.com/token/0x60930de2669670d1768108a77244f8ef56b4c544?a=0x486844e15606aa9e4eb9b66fccf038404d7ec91b), where the tokens are located at the time of this writing. 13.8% were distributed among various scammer addresses. Perhaps an attempt to make the token distribution appear more normal. The below transactions show where funds have been sent:</p><p>Transfer transaction to address (A): https://bscscan.com/tx/0x2d97020d6751d01b7367c3266313642ae83e0054bca21a47833a9c9d4501a421<br>Transfer transaction to address (B): https://bscscan.com/tx/0x6c26372cdbc781e09966b34a9242ec93d526a2b0f8d975ba0f3b3c607d654fea<br>Transfer transaction to address (C): https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4f08766c87dcfa9ade917a5e097b89542c0e262069f52db6187da820442ca448</p><p>The address (A) created a liquidity pool between $BNB and $KLB.
