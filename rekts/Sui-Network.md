**Quick Summary**

Sui Network, a fake token on Binance Smart Chain, was involved in an exit scam. The deployer sent 1 billion $SUI tokens to the scammer who added initial liquidity and later drained it.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Sui Network is not related to the original SUI token. On October 22nd, 2022, the deployer transferred 1 billion $SUI tokens to a scammer's address. The scammer used these tokens along with 20 $BNB to add liquidity to the PancakeSwap pool. On May 22nd, 2023, after waiting for several months without any activity or trading volume on this fake token project; the scammer removed all available LP funds worth around $196k USD by draining them from the PancakeSwap pool and transferred them into another EOA address. Currently, there is only about $300 USD worth of $BNB remaining as liquidity in that pool.
