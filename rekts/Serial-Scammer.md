 **Details of the Exploit**

The scammer would add liquidity to facilitate purchases and then drain all the $WETH from the pool just a few days later. The funds lost were calculated as the current holdings of the scammer, totaling 255.16 $ETH and 33 $WETH.

The scammer utilized a token factory they themselves deployed, allowing them to generate these fraudulent tokens. A closer examination reveals a similar pattern in all the tokens created by the scammer. One such instance involved the removal of liquidity using a specific token, resulting in a substantial withdrawal of approximately 68k USD worth of ETH.
