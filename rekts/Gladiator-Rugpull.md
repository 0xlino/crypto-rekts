 **Details of the Exploit**

The attack on the Gladiator project was carried out by the deployer, who removed liquidity from the LP pool. Following the removal, the stolen funds were transferred through various EOA addresses, possibly to obfuscate the trail of the stolen assets. The lack of further details on fund distribution may suggest the ongoing concealment of stolen funds.
