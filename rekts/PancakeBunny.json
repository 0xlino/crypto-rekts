    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>PancakeBunny's VaultFlipToFlip vault was exploited using 8 flash loans, leading to a skewed calculation of the BUNNY price and a loss of approximately $1B in BUNNY tokens.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The attacker manipulated the price on various PancakeSwap pools using 8 flash loans, which skewed the calculation of the BUNNY price in the VaultFliptoFlip vault. They borrowed WBNB from seven different PancakeSwap pools and USDT from Fortube Bank, deposited a portion of these funds into the WBNB+BUSDT pool, and swapped a large amount of WBNB for BUSDT. This manipulation allowed them to claim a reward of 6.97M BUNNY, valued at about $1B, from VaultFlipToFlip. After the exploit, they returned the flash loans to the PancakeSwap pools and Fortube Bank.</p><p><br></p><p>Stolen funds:</p><p>- 6.97M BUNNY (~$1B)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>The attacker's address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xa0acc61547f6bd066f7c9663c17a312b6ad7e187</p><p>The transaction behind the attack:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x897c2de73dd55d7701e1b69ffb3a17b0f4801ced88b0c75fe1551c5fcce6a979</p>",
