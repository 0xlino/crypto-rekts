**Quick Summary**

Stars Arena, an Avalanche-based project, was exploited through a reentrancy attack, leading to a loss of 2,974,530 USD worth 266,102 AVAX.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Stars Arena is a social platform on the Avalanche chain. On October 7, 2023, the platform suffered a reentrancy attack. The attacker drained funds from the Stars Arena contract, amounting to 2,974,530 USD (266,102 AVAX). The Attacker created a contract that distributed the stolen funds to many addresses, sending 1,000 AVAX each. During the call of the 0xe9ccf3a3 function, the attacker reentered and called the 0x5632b2e4 function, setting a block height. This height was then used as a parameter in the sellShares function, resulting in an abnormally large calculated amount of AVAX to send.
