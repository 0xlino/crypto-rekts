**Quick Summary**

Rari Capital Ethereum Pool exploited through manipulation of ibETH.totalETH() value, resulting in the withdrawal of more ETH than deposited by the attacker.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The attacker initiated the exploit by flash loaning ETH from dYdX and depositing it into the Rari Capital Ethereum Pool. They then manipulated the value of ibETH.totalETH() to artificially inflate it. This allowed them to withdraw more ETH from the Rari Capital Ethereum Pool than they had initially deposited. The value of ibETH.totalETH() returned to its true value at the end of ibETH.work, leaving the Rari Capital Ethereum Poolâ€™s balances lower than before the attack due to the attacker's inflated withdrawal.
