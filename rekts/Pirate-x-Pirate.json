Users who deposited their PXP tokens into the contract had their tokens transferred to an EOA account (0x3b74a9cb5f1399b4a5a02559e67da37d450067b7). The contract would then call transferFrom to transfer the tokens back to the user upon withdrawal. The attacker provided a valid sign from the external signer (0x7435e0e4c4d10988e8821dc4853d1db2eceb176d) and withdrew 9,681,000 PXP tokens.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>The staking contract: 0x6912B19401913F1bd5020b3f59EE986c5792DA54</p><p>Attacker: 0x3b74a9cb5f1399b4a5a02559e67da37d450067b7&nbsp;</p><p>External signer: 0x7435e0e4c4d10988e8821dc4853d1db2eceb176d.</p>",
