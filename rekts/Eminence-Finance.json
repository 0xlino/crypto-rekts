The smart contracts for Eminence were deployed without announcement and quickly discovered by the community. Users could deposit DAI into the smart contract and receive EMN in return. EMN could be exchanged for five other tokens (eAAVE, eLINK, eYFI, eSNX, and eCRV). The attacker exploited these contracts by taking out a flash loan for 15 million DAI from Uniswap and used this to buy EMN. He then traded and burned half this EMN for eAAVE, driving up EMN\u2019s price. He then traded the rest of his EMN for DAI, traded his eAAVE to mint more EMN and then finally traded this EMN for DAI. This process was repeated three times to net the hacker 15,015,533 DAI. 8M DAI were returned back to the Yearn deployer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker Address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x223034edbe95823c1160c16f26e3000315171ca9</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3503253131644dd9f52802d071de74e456570374d586ddd640159cf6fb9b8ad8</p><p><br></p><p>Returned DAI Transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7bc97357364222207f1f011b22ad98ba78fcd3c25d3398346caa3928cdf4a4dd</p>",
