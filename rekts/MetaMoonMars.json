The token deployer used a privileged function to set a huge fee multiplier</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>MetaMoonMars is a BEP20 token trading on PancakeSwap. The contract of the token contained privileged function aprove() which sets a fee multiplier. At first, the fee was 8 percent, and after some period the function was called again, setting a fee of 99 percent. Users were not able to buy a fair amount of tokens, and their funds were transferred into the pool. Cause of the huge fee, users couldn't sell the little amount of $M3 token they receive. The scammer profited for 866 $USD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xda7e1666ab637609fc2d5833dae1056976a17c96</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transactions:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x93a828726c00f117915ab10489c512b0c39e1ed2dd4c2282c13bddd2b26fdcc0</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xe4095741fdbe2452f5f2ce416fbf012a4ea2549d6b0155ac4871dcbebfdc78d7</p><p><br></p><p>Tokens transfer transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x77c2be9454da2b720939254736f941370532d34d8bff4322033c1888f13ce378</p>",
