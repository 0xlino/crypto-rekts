**Quick Summary**

The Wormhole bridge was compromised by an attacker that bypassed the verification process and made away with 120,000 $WETH.

 **  
Details of the Exploit**

  


1\. The attacker minted 120,000 wETH on Solana:

3\. The hacker used some funds to buy SportX ($SX), Meta Capital ($MCAP), Finally Usable Crypto Karma ($FUCK), and Bored Ape Yacht Club Token ($APE), the example transactions:

4\. The remaining wETH was swapped for SOL and USDC on Solana. The hackerâ€™s Solana wallet currently holds 432,662 SOL ($44 million):

Probably the issue was in the signature verification process. So it lead to an unverified call by the attacker.

Investors were made whole by Jump Trading the mother company behind the wormhole bridge that replenished the stolen ETH.
