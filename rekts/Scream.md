**Quick Summary**

Scream has incurred 35,000,000 $USD in bad debt after the $FUSD and $DEI stablecoins lost their peg to $USD

 **  
Details of the Exploit**

Scream is a lending and borrowing protocol running on the Fantom blockchain. After $FUSD and $DEI tokens lost their peg to $USD, whales took advantage of this situation and deposited large amounts of $FUSD and $DEI to drain other stablecoins like $FUSDT, $FRAX, $DAI, $MIM and $USDC from the platforms smart contract. 

The Lending Protocol also lost roughly 50% of the total value locked on the platform.
