The attacker utilized a loophole in the token's in_transfer function, which was designed to give bonuses to new token holders when a Pancake pair sends tokens to the new user. However, the contract failed to account for a malicious user forcing a Pancake/Uniswap pair to transfer tokens to any address via a skim() call. The attacker took a flash loan, bought 3913 tokens, and repeatedly transferred these tokens to the pair address while calling skim(), tricking the contract into giving away all available bonuses. As of November 20, 2023, the stolen funds, amounting to $31,354.82 USD, still remain in the scammer's address as BSC-USD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xb29F18B89E56cC0151C7C17DE0625A21018D8ae7</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x8163738d6610ca32f048ee9d30f4aa1ffdb3ca1eddf95c0eba086c3e936199ed</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x783FBEa45b32eAAA596b44412041DD1208025E83</p>",
