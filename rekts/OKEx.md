On Aug. 28, a user reported that his OKEx account was logged in by a German IP and participated in BTC-ETC trading. The hacker sold all the Bitcoins and canceled all the pending orders within one hour.  
  
Such behavior has resulted in a loss of 200 Bitcoins, which are worth more than five mln yuan.  
  
At the same time, a few other users reported similar attacks. All victims have lost about six hundred Bitcoins in total, worth over 20 mln yuan (about three mln dollars).  
  
Based on the current situation, OKEx has made an announcement.  
  
OKEx claimed that the theft was performed by hackers, and it has nothing to do with the platform. The victims were directed to call the police by themselves.
