The platform discovered a mistake in one of its smart contracts: ‘options.length' rather than ‘optionIDs.length.' This resulted in no liquidity for expiring contracts since user assets were locked whenever they did not utilize their options. Hegic spent $48K to fix the problem and reimburse impacted users.
