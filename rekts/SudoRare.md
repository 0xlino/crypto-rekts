Quick Summary

The owner of SudoRare contracts used privileges and transferred all deposited assets from SudoRare Pools. The contracts contained security issues as minting and privileges to freely transfer any types of assets from the pools contract were accessible by the owner. 

  


Details of the Exploit

SudoRare was a NFT platform with staking features using $XMON, $LOOKS and $ETH assets. After reaching certain amount of assets, the owner of the SudoRareGenesisPool contract used his privileges to withdraw funds including 6 $XMON (125.4 $ETH), 1,115,216 $LOOKS (192 $ETH) and 200 $wETH. After the withdrawal, all assets were sold on UniSwap for $wETH. The total of the ill-gotten funds amounted to 517,4 wETH, which were transferred to three newly added addresses.   
Subsequently, a huge amount of $SR tokens (87.7 % of total supply) was transferred to another address. Official site sudorare.xyz has been downed and social accounts have been deleted.
