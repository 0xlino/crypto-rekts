The total losses of the security breach are:  
1454 BTC  
225,263 TRC  
23,400 LTC  
  
The attacker has acquired login credentials to the Vircurex VPS control account with their hosting service provider and has then asked for the root password reset of all servers which – unfortunately – the service provider has then done and posted the credentials in their helpdesk ticket, rather than the standard process of sending it to Vircurex email address (which had 2FA protection), also the security setup of allowing only Vircurex IP range to login to the management console was not working. It was an additional security feature the provider offered but was obviously circumvented by the attacker.
