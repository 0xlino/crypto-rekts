The validator key scheme is set up to be decentralized so that it limits an attack vector, but the attacker found a backdoor through a gas-free RPC node, which they abused to get the signature for the Axie DAO validator. Binance managed to identify and recover $5,8 million in funds spread across 86 accounts that had been moved to their exchange. In the aftermath of the Ronin bridge hack a Binance led funding round raised $150 million in order to partially repay users and ensure that operations will be sustained</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>The hacker's address on Ethereum:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0x098b716b8aaf21512996dc57eb0615e2383e2f96</p>",
