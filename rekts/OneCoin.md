OneCoin was a Ponzi scheme that pulled in $4 billion from 2014 to 2016. OneCoin was not actively traded, nor could the coins be used to purchase anything. Its founder, Ruja Ignatova, has disappeared, and co-founder Sebastian Greenwood is in jail in the U.S. The companyâ€™s main business was selling course materials, which turned out to be plagiarized in most cases. Its course material business model was akin to a multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme, where course material buyers were paid to recruit new buyers.
