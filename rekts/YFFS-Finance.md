According to reports around 300 ETH (~$130,000) was raised in a private pre-sale that took place over the span of under a minute.

  


The developer was aiming to deploy some of the ETH raised in the pre-sale into Uniswap, to allow speculators to bet on the coin. But when it came time to deploy these funds, the Telegram channel was deleted.
