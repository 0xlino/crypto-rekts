The attacker was funded with BNB from a Binance exchange wallet to cover gas fees for the deployment of contracts with malicious logic. These smart contracts created a series of event logs, including both legitimate and faulty peg-out requests. Due to a bug in the Rust code section responsible for extracting these log events, both types of logs were extracted and incorrectly processed, leading to the exploit. As a result, 277 BTC were stolen from the pBTC-on-BSC collateral.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x2bf5693dd3a5cea1139c4510fdce120cf042c934</p><p><br></p><p>First Exploit Transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x0eb55e02bce39ec1d2d2e911eca7dcca54e74841b53412c078185e43c5a2a551</p><p><br></p><p>Funding Transaction from Binance:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x23db0ee27e10517dea0659a743fd6df92d482ad6796851c71127e5049e7bbd88</p><p><br></p><p>BTC Addresses of the Attacker:</p><p>https://pastebin.com/raw/bAquZVws</p>",
