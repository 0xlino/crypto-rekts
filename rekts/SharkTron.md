**Quick Summary**

Malicious function in the staking contract allowed the contract deployer to transfer 229M TRX from it. The tokens were then spread to different EOAs and exchanges.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The contract deployer had the ability to call the rrInfo() function in the staking contract, which was designed for the malicious transfer of TRX from it. An example of this function calling resulted in a 1M TRX transfer. The code of the smart contract isnâ€™t verified. The deployer then bought SRX and SWD on JustSwap. There was another malicious function, getAllT(), which was used to perform a rug pull, removing 229M TRX from the staking contract. These TRXs were then sent to other EOAs.
