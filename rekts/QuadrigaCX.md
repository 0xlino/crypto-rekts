**Quick Summary**

QuadrigaCS owes its customers approximately 190,000,000 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

According to a court petition, the troubled Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX owes its clients $190 million and is unable to access the majority of the assets.  
  
Jennifer Robertson, the widow of QuadrigaCX founder Gerald Cotten, stated in a signed document filed Jan. 31 with the Nova Scotia Supreme Court that the exchange owes its clients around $250 million CAD ($190 million) in both bitcoin and cash. The firm previously declared on its website that it had filed for creditor protection, but the document itself reveals further information about its plight.  
  
According to the petition, there were around 115,000 individuals with balances signed up on the exchange as of January 31, 2019, with $70 million CAD in fiat and $180 million CAD in crypto owing altogether.  
  
Cotten reportedly died of Crohn’s disease in Jaipur, India in early December 2018. The exchange announced his death earlier this month. A death certificate was included in the list of exhibits. The founder seemingly had sole control or knowledge of Quadriga’s cold storage solution. Robertson wrote that after his death, “Quadriga’s inventory of cryptocurrency has become unavailable and some of it may be lost.”
