This exploit netted the deployer approx. $30k in ill-gotten funds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The Wolf protocol promised to be a DeFi revolution offering staking and yield solutions on three different blockchains. The website boasted a fake team and a fake roadmap. The smart contract contained malicious rights that could only be invoked by the token deployer and enabled a centralized token balance modification. In simple terms, the token deployer could change the balance of any holder.</p><p>The contract deployer added initial liquidity at:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x28d4d2d427c2c18295bcdc92f95af81f1e5ba9de78072d0d08cf647625800bb1</p><p>This made the token tradable. Within 11 days, the community noticed that the $WLFP could not be sold or withdrawn. The root of this can be found in this transaction, where the contract deployer locked liquidity:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4b4c05789728e2f0a1652e992c81af6b2b1a03685731b1b9f5cea41845872912<br>After users were trapped the contract deployer proceeded to invoke the <u>approveAndCall</u>() function, which included an external wallet and <u>addedValue&nbsp;</u>amount as the input data:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa0dcdb89aefaf04ab17bf00ba028d5dc0ef763c61143eea137cd69eaff964401<br>After the external wallet received the enhancement in its token balance, the external wallet dumped $WLFP for $ETH34t:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x54e39afc20e9884205e77a9bf81296f41ec3ad21815e449693834045f6b88593</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Project deployer</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x871f91e2d25edcec66a5c03fe82178d55c1bbd34</p><p><br></p>",
