This Trojan had likely been present for several months, gathering enough information to execute the attack. Cryptsy was alerted of a decrease in their safe/cold wallet balances of Bitcoin and Litecoin, as well as a few other minor cryptocurrencies, leading to the discovery of the exploit.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>The transactions made by the attacker can be found at the following link:</p><p>https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/0c07e0bec1002bd2</p><p><br></p>",
