The tokens were then spread to different EOAs and exchanges.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The contract deployer had the ability to call the rrInfo() function in the staking contract, which was designed for the malicious transfer of TRX from it. An example of this function calling resulted in a 1M TRX transfer. The code of the smart contract isn\u2019t verified. The deployer then bought SRX and SWD on JustSwap. There was another malicious function, getAllT(), which was used to perform a rug pull, removing 229M TRX from the staking contract. These TRXs were then sent to other EOAs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The contract deployer:</p><p>https://tronscan.org/#/address/TJTAYhG2EwqWuMF6v1UFP3KqZXX32UBtdz</p><p><br></p><p>Example of the function calling (1M TRX transfer):</p><p>https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/f1aa69f5bb2c70572006ffc7b94f8b000c1f047d00b57224357cbd0bce80b1f7</p><p><br></p><p>Transaction of 229M TRX removed from staking contract:</p><p>https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/f381e7d013022504257e02d3e6b51bef247ed94b8e916999dbb33a3e07a919af</p><p><br></p><p>Transactions of TRXs sent to other EOAs:</p><p>https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/793669f6efa3321704c06578a6941fca6f4a098512c7ff9808802c90da5fbd4f</p><p>https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/c1bf2b328ce16f53d65908b21d128ca7e5492ec848f9f3cf8a577ea907a9e460</p><p>https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/e68088aff5aa8dd688faa4b7b4d679aed5e74fc2969036207d07da8f12cc3fb8</p><p>https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/657315fb2bd3e3581376d691b26f87691166927273cbd937243dfcdb52b3128f</p>",
