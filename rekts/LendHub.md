**Quick Summary**

The LendHub lending protocol on the Heco network was exploited for about $6M USD. 

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The vulnerability was in lBSV contract duplication. Both versions of it were active, thus the hacker after depositing to the old version was able to borrow in the new market. It allows the flow of the minting and redemption process to be exploited and brings a profit worth 6M USD.

  


After that, the attacker started bridging assets to other chains like Ethereum and Optimism.
