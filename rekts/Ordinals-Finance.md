**Quick Summary**

Ordinals Finance was rugpulled by the token deployer and two related addresses for 1,015,192 $USD. 

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Ordinals Finance is a project that claimed it would build a protocol for developing decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Bitcoin. However, this claim was false since the project used Ethereum to create its native $OFI token. The rugpull happened on the Ethereum chain where funds worth 1,015,192 $USD have been stolen.

The deployer withdrew $OFI tokens from the OFIStaking contract using a privileged function and swapped claimed tokens for $WETH before consolidating funds into one account under their control with the newly deployed OEBlock Token also being used in the attack.

Two deployer-related EOA addresses were identified as accomplices in draining WETH/OFI UniswapV2 pools using $OFI tokens while transferring 551 $ETH to TornadoCash.
