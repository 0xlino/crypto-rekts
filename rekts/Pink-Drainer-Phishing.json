    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>\"Pink Drainer\" group orchestrates extensive phishing scams, draining approximately 3,548,566 $USD from victims.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The group \"Pink Drainer\" has been connected to a series of Discord and Twitter hacking incidents, including but not limited to those involving Evomos, Pika Protocol, OpenAI CTO, and Orbiter Finance. They've distributed phishing links through hacked Discord accounts, leading to numerous users inadvertently opening malicious websites and signing fraudulent digital signatures. This has resulted in a significant loss of user assets, amounting to around 3,548,566 $USD.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Through the analysis of stolen data on various chains, it was discovered that the group has affected almost 1,932 victims. The method of hacking was mostly through carefully crafted social engineering attacks, leading to Discord token theft.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Impersonating journalists from well-known media outlets and leading victims through seemingly genuine interview processes were among their tactics. Eventually, the victims were guided to add malicious bookmarks or bots, resulting in their Discord tokens being stolen.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker Addresses:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x9fA7bB759641FCd37fe4aE41f725e0f653f2C726</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d23354d181b3488f951a23d63762d932ef105b2</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xa5e4b451d0a3c3d05fc3a8076fda45952b8f4f83</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x6337f2366e6f47fb26ec08293867a607bcc7a0db</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x6440e4dC6ECF11E3c867371f51227974ff9AB41c</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transaction Example:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xab4fae9ea4b43653b70e6be6035445120b77db266b48d5ff8e87caf29187f9d3</p><p><br></p><p>PinkDrainer Contract:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000f312c54d0dd25888ee9cdc3dee988700000<br><br>PrinkDrainer Deployer:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0xa5ae511595818d62d5bbc332d01bf9ba3f887af1</p><p><br></p><p>PinkDrainer Wallet:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0x63605e53d422c4f1ac0e01390ac59aaf84c44a51<br><br>Full victim list:<br>https://dune.com/scamsniffer/pinkdrainer-stats</p>",
