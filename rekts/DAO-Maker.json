They initially stole 10,000 USDC and then made 15 more transactions to acquire additional funds, totaling approximately $7 million. The attack affected 5,251 user accounts. According to DAO Maker CEO Christoph Zaknun, the Strong Holder Offering (SHO) contract was targeted because the number of deposits exceeded their expectations. Users with up to $900 in their accounts were reportedly unaffected as the platform moved their funds into different wallets. DAO Maker has suspended all deposits pending a full Root Cause Analysis. Blockchain intelligence firm CipherBlade is conducting an investigation into the hack and has identified a Binance account associated with the attacker. DAO Maker is exploring compensation options for all affected users.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>The attacker's address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xd8428836ed2a36bd67cd5b157b50813b30208f50</p><p><br></p><p>The contract used to perform the attack:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x1c93290202424902a5e708b95f4ba23a3f2f3cee#code</p><p><br></p><p>The transaction of the attack execution:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xeefc22f2dbd8e1b886a7e59f66511e2735f4d04484f6258a9db6e661ed490f7b</p><p><br></p><p>The victim's contract:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x41B856701BB8c24CEcE2Af10651BfAfEbb57cf49#code</p><p><br></p><p>The transaction of the stolen funds transfer:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa8a61f779f514e59efa05a98152cf56c1942eff6cc56f506dab7c662ac1e775e</p>",
