The attacking smart contract deployed by the hacker has included the <u>unlockAll</u>() trigger repeatedly (40 times) in the event, so he was able to unlock more than the amount he locked in before.<br><br>The attacker withdrew 9,959.26 SDS, then sold for 95,392 USDC after bridging all to Ethereum.</p>",
