**Quick Summary**

FDO token slippage happened on PancakeSwap. The attacker took 96,000 $FDO tokens from the project's vault contract and sold them for 160,441 $USD

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

FDO is a BEP20 token and can't be confused with other tokens with the same symbol. The EOA address claimed 96,000 $FDO from the project's vault smart contract with unverified source code. Consequently, the attacker sold them on PancakeSwap for 160,441 $BUSD and transferred them to another EOA address.  The relationship between the attacker and the project's team is not approved.
