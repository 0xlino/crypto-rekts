**Quick Summary**

BabyDogeCoin suffered from flashloan attack, which led to a loss of 135,013 $USD worth of $BNB.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

BabyDogeCoin is a BEP20 token trading on the project's own DEX BabyDogeSwap. The BabyDogePair pool was affected by a flash loan attack. The attack started after the exploiter deployed a malicious contract and took 80,000 $BNB as a flash loan. Consequently, the price of $BabyDoge was manipulated by the attacker, and then 80,509 $BNB was drained from the pool. The flashloan was repaid and the attacker's profit reached 437 $BNB which is worth 135,013 $USD at the moment. The stolen assets were transferred to a couple of EOA addresses which were then transferred to the FixedFloat crypto exchange.
