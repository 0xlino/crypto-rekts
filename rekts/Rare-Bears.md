The project's admin account on Discord was compromised. The attacker posted a phishing link on the server, which led to the fake NFT minting website. The compromised account deleted admin roles from the project team, so no one could prevent this immediately.  
  
As a result, users spent approx 73 ETH which were stolen by this address:  
https://etherscan.io/address/0x67542f6e4ea651f4c72ab24abf2eb9c2c202fce1  
  
After, the Discord server ownership was regained by the team.
