**Quick Summary**

MINA token experienced an exit scam on Oct 25, 2023, with scammers rugpulling and stealing 106,395 USD worth of funds from PancakeSwap liquidity pool.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

MINA is a BEP20 token trading on PancakeSwap. The deployer renounced ownership after creating the token, possibly to facilitate a future hack. A scammer minted a significantly larger number of tokens and then rug pulled by selling 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 MINA, completely depleting the liquidity pool. The scammers sent the stolen funds in separate parts through several addresses to the Binance wallet, resulting in a total loss of 106,395 USD worth 474.25 WBNB.
