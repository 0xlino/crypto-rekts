 **Details of the Exploit**

ArbiSwap is a DEX on the layer-2 chain Artibtrum. ArbiSwap was launched on February 24th, 2023, and offered the project's $ARBI token owners 100% of the revenue generated by DEX. The project quickly reached up to 4,400,000 $USD in TVL. An ArbiSwap developer reported that their own man robbed the DEX, draining 84.6 $ETH from the $ARBI/$USDC pair. In the last 24 hours after the incident, the $ARBI token price dropped by 99%. The attacker has minted nearly 1,000,000,000,000 $ARBI tokens and drained the liquidity for 138,057 $USD. All the stolen funds were transferred through TornadoCash.
