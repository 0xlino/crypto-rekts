    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>On April 19, 2023, an attacker hacked the Ocean Life token on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), using a flawed mechanism to lower the token supply and manipulate the price. The attacker earned 32 WBNB in return for their actions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The attacker used a flash loan of 969 WBNB from DPPOracle and converted it to OLIFE tokens using PancakeSwap. By internally calling the '_reflectFee' function through the transfer function, the attacker decreased the total value of _tTotal. However, the balance of the pool was much higher after accumulation, as computed using balanceOf(), and the hacker used a direct call to swap to withdraw $WBNB from the pool. The attacker then returned the 969 WBNB flashloan and transferred the 32 WBNB profit to another address.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker's transaction:&nbsp;</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xa21692ffb561767a74a4cbd1b78ad48151d710efab723b1efa5f1e0147caab0a</p><p>Attacker address:&nbsp;</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xfb8ef8de849079559801bff8848178640cdd41b7</p><p>Stolen funds address:&nbsp;</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x662D2dC484D65a3Ba4Da80E36EAa9a400AF0726B</p>",
