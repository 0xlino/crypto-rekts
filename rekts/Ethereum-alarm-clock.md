**Quick Summary**  

The Ethereum Alarm Clock smart contract was exploited, leading to the theft of $260K in gas fees as of October 2022.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**  

Hackers exploited a bug in the Ethereum Alarm Clock smart contract code, allowing them to profit on returned gas fees from canceled transactions. They essentially called cancel functions on their contracts with inflated transaction fees, and a bug in the smart contract refunded them a greater value of gas fees than they initially paid, allowing them to pocket the difference. This has resulted in the theft of $260K in gas fees so far.
