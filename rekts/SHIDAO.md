On May 25th, SHIDAO was rug pulled for ~$180K. The project falsified the CertiK audit in order to gain the trust of its customers and lure them to rugpool.

  


Rug funding address: https://bscscan.com/address/0x1815b5805DD5260b644B8db230763e38df4C5d7f which distributed BNB for a tx fee, funds approximately 25 other addresses with 0.02 BNB for token sales.

The ShiD tokens are then distributed by the contract https://bscscan.com/address/0xC86D17c77dfCc002c17c4cBed83040795C0Ea9A1 to all the addresses.  After funding completes, the wallets sold their tokens.
