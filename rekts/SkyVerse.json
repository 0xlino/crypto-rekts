The project's Twitter account and website were recreated and then 150,000 $USD worth of $ETH was withdrawn from the affected user's wallets. The scammer convinced over 250 NFT collectors that the project had started minting and was rapidly selling out. The scammer used a fake \"counter\" on the website to make it seem like the NFTs were selling out in real-time</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Scammer address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x1203abb79F7343d2dAAa245ADF6fcB3Ab0D7e356</p>",
