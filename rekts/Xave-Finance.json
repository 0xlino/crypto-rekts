    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>Xave Finance was exploited and the hacker was able to mint over 99% of the $RNBW token's original supply. The accident dropped the token price by more than 99%.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>Xave Finance also known as HaloDAO is a platform that aims to provide DeFi operations to traditional financial institutes. $RNBW is an ERC20 token of the project, that is listed on Coinbase. The hacker deployed a smart contract to exploit the DaoModule contract and executed the proposal to take ownership of the contract. Consequently, the attacker minted 100,000,000,000,000 $RNBW tokens to his address and swapped them for 89,000,000,000,000 $xRNBW tokens. All the stolen amounts sit at the hacker's address at the moment, and their value is unknown.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x0f44f3489d17e42ab13a6beb76e57813081fc1e2</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xe167cdaac8718b90c03cf2cb75dc976e24ee86d3</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc18ec2eb7d41638d9982281e766945d0428aaeda6211b4ccb6626ea7cff31f4a</p>",
