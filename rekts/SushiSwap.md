**Quick Summary**

SushiSwap experienced an approval related bug, which led to a loss of nearly 3,505,000 $USD from the user's wallet.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

SushiSwap, a cross-chain decentralized exchange, experienced an exploit due to a bug related to approvals of its RouterProcessor2 contract. The vulnerability led to losses of nearly 3,505,000 $USD from the user named sifuvision.eth . 

The hack was caused by a smart contract bug on SushiSwap's RouterProcessor2 contract, which allowed attackers to pass security checks and withdrew affected user's approved tokens. The incident affected users who swapped on the platform within four days before detection.

After detecting the exploit, Jared Grey, head developer at SushiSwap urged users to revoke permissions for all contracts on their platform while they worked with security teams to mitigate issues.

An interesting part of the story is, the initial hack of 100 $ETH was performed by white hat, that tweeted about the vulnerability and returned 90 $ETH back. But several EOA addresses used the same vulnerability to exploit the same user for bigger amount of 1,790 $ETH.

Jared Grey, announced the returning of 300 $ETH with the help of the community, and is working on to return 700 $ETH from Lido Vault.
