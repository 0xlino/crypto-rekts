    "description": "<p>The protocol did not handle the rebase event correctly. It enabled a user to start Uniswap sell transaction immediately following the modification of wallet balances, but before any price change in the token was registered.<br><br>The rebase event functioned wrong. Because the YFI to SYFI conversion rate was incorrectly entered, an erroneous balance change was started. Together, these two errors permitted a transaction to be initiated that would basically remove the pool's aggregate cash.<br><br>The transaction, where the external address buys 2 SYFI using 0.5 ETH on the Uniswap:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xed33e727dd5b2f8e5164f6e15dabc1923652f2e933645378a87c45bf33c4e59a<br><br>15 minutes later, the same external address sells 15,551 SYFI for 747 ETH after the positive rebase event:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbb45a3aaa222432f50974b4be0852445e446698d33b0fcd47a4f627a2764ea83</p>",
