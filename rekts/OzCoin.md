OzCoin, a Bitcoin mining pool, has reported that an unknown attacker managed to hack into their server, defacing their website and database and stealing 923 BTC ($135,000) from their Bitcoin wallet. However, in less than a day over half of the money was seized as it was passing through the web wallet StrongCoin, and promptly returned to Ozcoin.
