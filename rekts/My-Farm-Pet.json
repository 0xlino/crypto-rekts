The attacker used 340k $BUSD to exchange for 22k $MYFARMPET, of which 1k were used to buy 70k $ChickenFood on My Farm Pets Marketplace V2. The contract then exchanged 21k $MYFARMPET tokens for 337k$BUSD, thereby increasing the pool on PancakeSwap, and exchanged 70k $ChickenFood on the V3 market for 34k $BUSD. Then, when the deposit of 340k was repaid, the attacker received a net profit of 31k $BUSD.</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\"><br></p>",
