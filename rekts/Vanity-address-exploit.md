 **Details of the Exploit**  

The exploit targeted a vulnerability related to the vanity address generator Profanity, likely using a brute force attack. A vanity address is a type of crypto address that conforms to certain parameters laid out by the creator. The hacker stole 732 Ethereum on September 25 before transferring the funds straight to Tornado Cash. The exploit leveraged a similar vulnerability related to the recent $160 million attack on market maker Wintermute.
