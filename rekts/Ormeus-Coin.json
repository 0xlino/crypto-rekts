The SEC alleges that the siblings made false claims about their mining operations, stating that Ormeus Coin had a $250 million crypto-mining operation and was generating millions of dollars in mining revenue every month when in reality the operation was generating less than $3 million in revenue. The SEC filed charges against the Barksdales for violating federal securities laws, and the siblings are facing potential prison sentences of between 5 and 20 years. The charges seek injunctive relief, disgorgement plus interest, and civil penalties.&nbsp;The Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York has also filed separate criminal charges against John Barksdale.<strong><br></strong></p>",
