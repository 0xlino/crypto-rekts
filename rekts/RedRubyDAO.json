The liquidity pool of the token is located on the W3Swap. The hacker deployed a malicious smart contract and transferred 85,000,000 $RRD tokens to the contract balance. Consequently, the hacker swapped 83,300,000 $RRD on W3swap and received 91,000 $BUSD in the same transaction. The remaining $RRD tokens were transferred to two EOA addresses. The stolen funds stay in the hacker's address at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x9a52daeb40b898b1af30c5c428243d4c827b18ad</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x771f25e77d78be8f1a4f01efa43bae9ca559d9a8</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x0bb6b1e49ed057f087dd31873c86b2d04316c91f51124f5bb17139d929bea209</p><p><br></p><p>Liquidity pool:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0xd577a5c16b08695230512d178855d0a9982c8864</p>",
