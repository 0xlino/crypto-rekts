When users buy PLOT tokens through the swap function, they get a certain amount of rebates, and the rebates will be It is sent to the user by calling <u>transferFrom</u> in the <u>_update</u> function in the contract. Since the <u>_update</u> function does not set the maximum amount of rebates in a pool, nor does it determine whether the total rebates are used up when rebates, malicious arbitrageurs can continue to call the swap function to exchange tokens to get the contract. </p>",
