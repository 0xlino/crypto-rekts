    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>The creators of the FlippazOne project created a NFT smart contract, which is also an auction contract. The contract included a serious vulnerability in the <em>ownerWithdrawAllTo()&nbsp;</em>function, in which there is no verification of the owner, which allows anyone to take all the funds of the contract through calling this public function.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The contract creator of FlippazOne created a contract with a vulnerability that enables anyone to withdraw all $ETH<strong>&nbsp;</strong>from the contract to any address. The vulnerability lies in the fact that this function does not have a check on the owner, which means anyone can pick up $ETH tokens to their address at any time. This account with address (https://etherscan.io/address/0x194a39f48f1d5e310d0e0cc25e727c7d2bff0b14) made a bid sending 1.5 $ETH to the FlippazOne contract that were successfully withdrawn by unverified contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0xb314fd4ac6e10a7e27929cbc8db96743739c82b6) in this transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x670da209fb1168941c4565a9a86f87d1011b24b857ea64f658b126a43f031fa0.</p><p>Then another 4 $ETH were withdrawn by EOA address in this transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf2cc19d4c8bfb04e35789e9b716c5f1ba8b893df3a821b104ed5f845230a3762</p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgb(65, 65, 65); font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'>As the time of this writing information on this case is scarce<strong>.
