    "description": "<p>Hackers deployed two reentrancy attacks, made possible by a known vulnerability found in the ERC777-token of Uniswap, to steal $300,000 and $1.1 million in imBTC tokens. Tokenlon, the company behind the imBTC token that runs on the Uniswap platform, provides a timeline of the events:<br><br>\u201c8:58 SGT on April 18th. An attacker used a vulnerability with Uniswap and ERC777 to perform a reentrancy attack.<br><br>12:12 on April 18th. The Tokenlon team observed the anomaly, defined the incident as a P0-level security issue, and established an emergency response team.<br><br>12:49 on April 18th. After evaluating the situation, Tokenlon suspended the transfer of imBTC and notified imBTC partners including Lendf.Me to evaluate potential security risks.<br><br>17:00 on April 18th. imBTC transfer was resumed after receiving the confirmation from Lendf.Me and other partners that it is OK to do so.<br><br>09:28 on April 19th. Tokenlon received a message from Lendf.me about a reentrancy attack, similar to the one happened to Uniswap, resulting in a large number of abnormal borrowing on the platform.<br><br>10:12 on April 19th. In order to cooperate with the investigation of the reentrancy attack, Tokenlon suspended the transfer of imBTC.\u201d</p>",
