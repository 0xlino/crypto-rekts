The attacker created a smart contract that was used to carry out an attack on the project in this transaction:&nbsp;</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xb660132567cf5fb60af136762729fd9ad0662baf01ac6cc74b0a285e5b3399dd</p><p>After creating the contract, the attacker called the function \"0x21e85463\" which caused a number of transactions to empty the protocol.
