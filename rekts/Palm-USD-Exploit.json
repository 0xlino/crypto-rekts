    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>$900K USD Lost in USDP Staking and Liquidity Exploit.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The root cause appears to be a design error in the USDP project's staking mechanism, which supports adding and removing liquidity. While the calculation of LP token amounts is dynamic, the functions buyUSDP() and sellUSDP() do not exhibit the same dynamism. This oversight created an exploitable vulnerability.</p><p><br></p><p>The attacker capitalized on this flaw by staking a substantial amount and subsequently using buyUSDP() to purchase a large quantity of USDP tokens. Upon buying, the attacker was able to execute removeLiquidity(), which returned most of the funds in BUSDT back. However, a significant balance of USDP remained. The USDP to BUSDT exchange rate being 1:1 guaranteed the return of the money.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xf84efa8a9f7e68855cf17eaac9c2f97a9d131366</p><p>Exploit tx:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x62dba55054fa628845fecded658ff5b1ec1c5823f1a5e0118601aa455a30eac9</p>",
