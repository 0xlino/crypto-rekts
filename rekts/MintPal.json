    "description": "<p>Mintpal faced a major hack on the 13th of July, causing 8,000,000 Vericoin to be stolen (value $2,000,000), which was about 30% of the circulating supply at the time. The exchange had kept their Vericoin on a \u201chot\u201d wallet (an online, internet-connected wallet), which is much more vulnerable.</p><p>Interestingly enough, the Bitcoin and Litecoin wallets were also targeted for the Mintpal hack. This turned out unsuccessful. The exchange had wisely decided to move these to a \u201ccold\u201d wallet (an offline wallet).</p>",
