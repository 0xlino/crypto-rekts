IOTA Foundation has shut down its entire network after hackers exploited a vulnerability in the official IOTA wallet app to steal user funds. The hackers were stealing funds from user wallets, the IOTA Foundation shut down "Coordinator," a node in the IOTA network that puts the final seal of approval on any IOTA currency transactions.  
  
IOTA members said hackers used an exploit in "a third-party integration" of Trinity, a mobile and desktop wallet app developed by the IOTA Foundation.  
  
The hackers targeted at least 10 high-value IOTA accounts and used the Trinity exploit to steal funds.
