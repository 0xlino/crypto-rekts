**Quick Summary**

EasyFi project's admin keys and mnemonics were stolen during the sophisticated remote attack. The hacker used keys to stole user's deposits in several protocol pools.

  
 **Details of the Exploit**  
The admin keys of the contract deployer were compromised by the attacker remotely. The attacker withdrew the user's deposits from the protocol pools, namely from the USDT/USDC/Matic/ETH/DAI markets. In addition, around 2.98 Million EASY were stolen from the protocol's contracts.
