**Quick Summary**

Furucombo proxy contract was exploited, resulting in the loss of various tokens worth millions of dollars.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The attacker manipulated the Furucombo proxy contract to believe that Aave V2 had a new implementation. This new implementation had the ability to transfer all approved tokens to addresses controlled by the attacker. This was possible because users had approved the Furucombo contracts to use their tokens on their behalf. The attacker was able to steal a variety of tokens including stETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, aWBTC, aWETH, aETH, aAAVE, WBTC, CRV, LINK, cETH, cUSDC, cWBTC, BAO, PERP, COMBO, PAID, UNIDX, GRO, and NDX. The total value of the stolen tokens is in the millions of dollars.
