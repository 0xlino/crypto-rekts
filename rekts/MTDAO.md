 **Details of the Exploit**  

On October 16th 2022, a suspicious flashloan occurred on the MTDAO (MT) project, which caused a significant slippage and a drop of around 90% in the value of the token. The flashloan was used to obtain 730 BNB, which is equivalent to around $280k. The funds were then sent to EOA 0xb2e8, which deposited them into TornadoCash, a privacy-focused Ethereum mixer. The rest of the funds, approximately $219k, were bridged to Ethereum mainnet and remain in EOA 0xD0665. It is unclear who is behind the exploit, and investigations are ongoing.
