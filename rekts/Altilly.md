Altilly was an unregulated crypto exchange, launched in mid-2018. It was announced in 2019 that Altilly was acquired by the Qredit team.  
  
While being in the phase of incorporation and acquiring the needed licenses to operate an exchange, Altilly got hacked in December 2020. Only a few months away from official company registration in Estonia.  
  
The exchange lost its funds due to an attack on its servers. Since the hack, a lot of funds were lost, unsaved, or stolen.
