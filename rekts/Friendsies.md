**Quick Summary**

The Friendsies NFT collection has been rug pulled by its founders, less than a year after raising $5 million at a Christie's auction on OpenSea, due to market volatility and challenges.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The founders of Friendsies announced on Twitter that they were pulling the rug on the project, blaming the current market conditions for preventing them from developing the project in a way they could be proud of. The project had been criticized by community members for deviating from its initial roadmap, with several aspects remaining undelivered, including a community treasury and a play-to-earn game. On-chain sleuth ZackXBT also revealed that the project's founders had not distributed 1.25% of all royalties to holders, as claimed in the project's official Discord server.
