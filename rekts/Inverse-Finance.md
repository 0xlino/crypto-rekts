**Quick Summary**

Inverse Finance was exploited due to price manipulation, resulting in a loss of approximately $14.5M in assets.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Inverse Finance, a DeFi platform, was exploited due to the manipulation of the 'external price oracle'. The attacker purchased INV tokens and manipulated the price to overestimate its value. This allowed the attacker to borrow 1588 ETH, 94 WBTC, 3999669 DOLA, and 39 YFI, which significantly exceeded their initial INV investment. The attacker deployed a malicious smart contract and used SushiSwap and Curve.fi to manipulate the price. Due to the small liquidity of SushiSwap on the INV/ETH pair, an exchange for 300 ETH was enough to change the price of the INV token. The attacker then deposited the funds in INV received at the preparation stage and minted 1746 XINV tokens. With the rise in the price of XINV, the attacker was able to borrow assets using the minted XINV tokens.
