**Quick Summary**

QAN Platform Bridge was hacked due to a private key compromise. The hacker gained access to the private key of the bridge deployer address and withdrew $QANX tokens from the bridge contract on both Ethereum and BSC chains.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

QAN Platform is the bridge between Ethereum and BSC chains. The hacker compromised the private keys of the bridge contract deployer and withdrew 1,444,000,000 $QANX tokens from the BSC chain and 1,459,000,000 $QANX tokens from the Ethereum chain. Consequently, the attacker swapped $QANX tokens which led to a drop in the token price by more than 99%. The hacker managed to withdraw 1,165,500 $USD worth of assets through TornadoCash.
