**Quick Summary**

Cypher Protocol, a decentralized futures exchange built on the Solana blockchain, was forced to freeze its smart contract after falling victim to an estimated $1 million exploit. The platform's team is actively investigating the incident and attempting to negotiate the return of stolen funds.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

On August 7, Cypher Protocol took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to inform its 13,500 followers about a security breach that had led to the suspension of its smart contract. The attack resulted in the pilfering of approximately 38,530 Solana (SOL) tokens and $123,184 USD Coin (USDC), totaling around $1,035,203 in ill-gotten gains. The exploit's alleged wallet promptly initiated transfers, including 30,000 USDC sent to Binance's Solana USDC address, "kiing.sol," suggesting an attempt to convert the stolen assets.

  


In response to the breach, numerous non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have been dispatched to the suspect's wallet, imploring the return of the unlawfully acquired funds. One NFT conveyed a stern message, highlighting the exposure of the attacker's actions: "Seriously though, you used Binance and KuCoin to fund and to try and get 30k out. People will find you. Please do the right thing and give the rest back." Another NFT adopted a more direct tone: "give it back you shitlord."

  


Notably, the attacker has yet to move any Solana-based funds to the Ethereum network as of the time of this publication.

  


This incident transpired amidst Cypher Protocol's mtnDAO hacker house event, which it co-hosts with fellow Solana protocol Marginfi. Notably, Marginfi emphasized that it remains separate from Cypher and remains unscathed by the breach.
