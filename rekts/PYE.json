    "description": "<p>PYE smart contract was exploited in a bunch of transactions. The example transaction:<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x3823a6841b025e871928306de1805d994366bc8d283494a8f15d0884e67fe2b1<br><br>The exploit occurred because of the lack of \"k invariant verification\" in the <u>swap</u>() routine, meaning that a caller verification was removed in the PYESwapPair. There are suspicions that this was an insider job.<br><br>The part of the stolen funds was deposited into the Tornado Cash mixer on the BNB chain, the rest was bridged to Ethereum and deposited into the mixer as well:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0x85b86b43d5fdb380c8b2c3b67f0fced3570a92ee</p>",
