The exploiter:  
\- deployed contract to trigger the exploit  
https://ftmscan.com/address/0x944b58c9b3b49487005cead0ac5d71c857749e3e  
  
\- minted XFTM by input only FSM token without entering any FTM  
\- collected XFTM token  
\- sold XFTM token to FTM  
\- bought more FSM and repeated the first step to get a larger amount of FTM  
\- sold all his FTM for ETH and bridged these ETH to Ethereum via Celer Bridge  
\- deposited stolen funds into Tornado Cash mixer:  
https://etherscan.io/address/0x47091e015b294b935babda2d28ad44e3ab07ae8d  
  
That contract exploited the error in Fantasmâ€™s Pool contract where the developer missed the condition checking for the minimum amount of input FTM when minting XFTM.
