**Quick Summary**

Fantom Foundation suffered a phishing attack on Oct 17, 2023, resulting in a loss of 7,359,282 USD worth 4701.84 ETH.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

In October 2023, an attacker targeted the Fantom Foundation, causing over 7 million USD in losses. The majority of the stolen funds belonged to an employee who was using wallets previously assigned to the Fantom Foundation. Early reports pointed to a vulnerability in Google Chrome, either a zero-day vulnerability or a known heap overflow vulnerability (CVE-2023-4863). The Fantom Foundation acknowledges the security incident, stating that approximately 550K USD was stolen from the Foundation itself, and the rest belonged to the employee. The attack vector remains unclear, and further investigation is ongoing.
