The staking contract of the platform was exploited due to an indexing-related logic issue. The attacker was able to receive 100,000 $CLOUD tokens using a malicious contract with an unverified source code, and then drain the PancakeSwap liquidity pool. The token price dropped by more than 75% cause of an exploit. The total funds lost reached roughly 265 $BNB which is worth 85,300 $USD at the moment. All the stolen funds were transferred through TornadoCash.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x16b904b61a5104e270521e759d27520bb97f1dd0</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4897b7fb241c72dc96d97ba4ad42c00654d47cb3961239f5088b878942b4d48d</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x09845b8e7d94c559697bfa860cea69bbc7b0495f</p><p><br></p><p>Transfer transaction example:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x49b8aa37ded9192deac81d251451072fd770caf8465b82675577e2d518dc04cb</p>",
