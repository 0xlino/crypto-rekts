Then the malicious actor swapped 2k $BNB for $USDT.</p><p>Step by step the transaction occurred as follows:<br>- The scammer took a flash loan for $250 $BNB<br>- The $BNB tokens were then exchanged for the $NFD tokens<br>- The scammer contract had the ability to create malicious contracts that also created contracts and transferred them all tokens received from airdrop.<br>- In the end, the last contract exchanges the entire balance of $NFD tokens for $BNB, transfers them to the main contract, restores the flash loan, and then the main contract transfers the funds to the scammer.<br><br>All the stolen funds have been transferred through tornado.cash.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address: https://bscscan.com/address/0x22c9736d4fc73a8fa0eb436d2ce919f5849d6fd2</p><p>Attacker contract address: https://bscscan.com/address/0xa35ef9fa2f5e0527cb9fbb6f9d3a24cfed948863</p><p>Flash Loan attack transactions:</p><p>1) https://bscscan.com/tx/0xb6f9b5ef1feeadb379a2de8f79bb04dd6920bfb214136d057eed4ce23a0003f8</p><p>2) https://bscscan.com/tx/0x8b77d75efa185295b09bdf2edcb509541fdde40ed5484212331ceac41b2f4ac0</p><p>Swap NFD to BNB transactions:</p><p>1) https://bscscan.com/tx/0x8c035fc9c3d944b3dd4a0ea721c119240cb624e79b7625a16173ad6682410599</p><p>2) https://bscscan.com/tx/0xda4b4de6ecacfe9b8b60167a2010630aeec103ab51920eb2e1b94ba1fef6c95b</p><p><br></p><p>Pair address: https://bscscan.com/address/0x26c0623847637095655b2868c3182b2285bdaeaf</p>",
