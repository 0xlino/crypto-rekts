An API key is a secure code that allows one application to access the services or data of another application, and in this case, the hackers were able to use stolen API keys to access and manipulate user accounts on the 3commas platform.</p><p><br></p><p>The exact amount of funds stolen is not publicly known, but reports suggest that it was substantial. The 3commas team responded to the exploit by implementing security upgrades and compensating affected users. They also took steps to educate users about the importance of securing their API keys and how to protect themselves from similar attacks in the future. The 3commas crypto API key exploit serves as a reminder of the importance of security in the cryptocurrency world and the need for users to be vigilant in protecting their API keys and other sensitive information.</p>",
