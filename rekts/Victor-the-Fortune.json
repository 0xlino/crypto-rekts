The hacker was able to mint $VTF tokens and made a profit of 58,450 $USD by selling them.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>Victor the Fortune is a BEP20 token trading on P2ESwap. The project was exploited via minting vulnerability. The hacker deployed a malicious smart contract with unverified source code to take a 100,000 $BUSD flash loan and bought $VTF tokens. Consequently, the malicious smart contract minted $VTF tokens to multiple newly deployed contracts and sold the tokens on P2ESwap. In the same transaction flash loan was paid back leaving a profit of 58,450 $BUSD to the attacker. The price of the $VTF token dropped by more than 98% at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x57c112cf4f1e4e381158735b12aaf8384b60e1ce</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x450595e4a42cc08c14091b08dbab654a68b0a877</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xeeaf7e9662a7488ea724223c5156e209b630cdc21c961b85868fe45b64d9b086</p>",
