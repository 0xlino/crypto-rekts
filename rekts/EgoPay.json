This hacker then proceeded to convert this fake value into irreversible currencies all within a one-hour window. These merchants believed that this value was in their EgoPay account, but unfortunately it was not.\"<br><br>A number of staff members were then suspended as it was concluded that someone from within the company had perpetrated the hack.</p>",
