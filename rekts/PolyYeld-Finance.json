    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>PolyYeld finance introduced a transfer fee, which was inconsistent with its masterchef contract. The resulting vulnerability was exploited by an attacker for $250k.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>PolyYeld Finance is a yield aggregator protocol on the Polygon network. PolyYield introduced the $xYELD token, a deflationary token in order to support its yield aggregator services. A fee was applied on the transfers of the $xYELD token. The PolyYeld Masterchef contract was not designed to support this token type, which created an exploit opportunity. After a series of deposits and withdraws, the $xYELD balance of the Masterchef became 1 WEI. The calculation of the $YELD rewards were based on the xYELD balance of the pool. <span style='color: rgb(65, 65, 65); font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'>This referral mechanism generated &nbsp;$YELD 49B tokens to the attackers address. The attacker dumped a part of his balance in order to receive $ETH 123. The funds were then bridged and transferred through Tornado.cash.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>The attacker's address:<br>https://polygonscan.com/address/0xa4bc39ff54e1b682b366b57d1f6b114a829f5c01</p><p><br></p><p>The transaction behind the hack:<br>https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x3c143d2a211f7448c4de6236e666792e90b2edc8f5035c3aa992fd7d7daca974<br><br><br></p>",
