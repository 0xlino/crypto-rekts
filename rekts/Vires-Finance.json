Ivanov has since pledged to slowly liquidate the debt without causing the coin to depeg. To manage the debt, Vires has limited withdrawals to $1,000 $USD per user per day. The company sporadically adds liquidity to Vires, which is quickly withdrawn. $USDN has managed to restore its $1 peg for a brief period and then lost a peg multiple times. In the end, the token lost its peg permanently and was rebranded, and now it is not stablecoin anymore. The new token was named Neutrino Index and has a $XTN symbol, and it has only 112,000,000 $USD as a TVL</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>XTN address:</p><p>https://new.wavesexplorer.com/assets/DG2xFkPdDwKUoBkzGAhQtLpSGzfXLiCYPEzeKH2Ad24p</p>",
