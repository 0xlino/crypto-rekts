Polish cryptocurrency exchange Coinroom has reportedly shut down its operations and disappeared with customer funds.  
  
Money.pl, a local business news outlet, received an email from one of its readers, who stated that Coinroom —  which was registered in 2016 — ceased operations overnight and disappeared with customers’ money in April. Some users say they had up to 60,000 zloty (around $15,790) in their accounts.  
  
Before ceasing its operations, Coinroom reportedly sent emails to its customers, containing information about contract terminations. Coiroom customers had only one day to withdraw their money, which was in accordance with Coinroom regulations signed by users. However, customers reportedly claim that some of them got only part of the money, while most of them did not receive their funds back at all.
