**Quick Summary**

A hacker exploited the illiquid BTC/CAD pair on Kraken, causing a 99% drop in the Bitcoin-to-Canadian Dollar (CAD) pair.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The attacker gained access to a compromised account with 1200BTC but was unable to withdraw. The attacker then placed his own limit of $100 buy orders on the illiquid BTC/CAD pair. Returning to the compromised account, the attacker dumped the 1200BTC on the BTC/CAD pair to himself, effectively becoming the legitimate owner of 1200BTC.
