On March 1, web hosting provider Linode was hacked, resulting in a theft of 3000 BTC from Slush and 43000 BTC from Bitcoinica. There have been two major BTC heists before, one 25,000 BTC theft in June and a 17,000 BTC theft from the BTC exchange Bitomat in August, resulting in the exchange being bailed out and acquired by MtGox.
