Details of the Exploit**

The hacker who is marked on the BSC as (SpaceGodzilla Exploiter) committed a flash loan attack on the young DAO_Officials project. The attacker created a contract (https://bscscan.com/tx/0x439d77a2b6d0ebf326ff9a11dd790c3f17a48776edb412a0dc3af38303abe2c1) in which the mock function was called, a script that executed a flash loan for a large amount in $USDT tokens:
