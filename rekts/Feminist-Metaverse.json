SakeSwapPair thus has a difference between token balance and reserve SakeSwapPair thus has a difference between token balance and reserve.</p><p>6) Then attacker calls the skim() function in SakeSwapPair to extract the difference in token balance to his own address.</p><p>7) Using PancakeSwap attacker swapped FmToken for BNB</p>",
