    "description": "<p>From the project's Twitter publication:<br><br>\"A malicious attacker has just utilized $TSD DAO to mint 11.8 billion tokens to his own account and sold all to Pancakeswap. Here is what happened:<br><br>1. Due to long Debt phase, people unbond from DAO because they no longer have rewards from expansion..<br><br>2. Dev account has only 9% of the DAO. We failed once when proposing the Implementation to enable the crosschain bridge. In this case, Dev account does not have enough stack to vote against the attacker.<br><br>3. What has been done by him? He gradually bought $TSD at low price to accumulate until he has more than 33% of the DAO. Then he proposed an Implementation and voted for it. Because he possess enough stack to finish the voting process, the Implementation went through successfully<br><br>In the Implementation, the attacker added code to mint for himself 11.8 billion $TSD. Then he sold all of the tokens to Pancakeswap. That's sad, it is an attack but it is how a decentralized DAO works.<br><br>Actually, the attacker minted 11.5 quintillion $TSD, not 11.8 billion. He sold 11.8 billion $TSD to Pancakeswap though -&gt;\"<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xb50cd62cb3e09dc98fa63d7eb7a5f707292e8e1725829ff5512d8d476b278faa</p>",
