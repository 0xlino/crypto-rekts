My farm pet is a blockchain farming game, where anyone can buy and own virtual farms.

The attacker created a contract in which there was a flashloan function to perform arbitration on the marketplace between versions V2 and V3. The attacker used 340k $BUSD to exchange for 22k $MYFARMPET, of which 1k were used to buy 70k $ChickenFood on My Farm Pets Marketplace V2. The contract then exchanged 21k $MYFARMPET tokens for 337k$BUSD, thereby increasing the pool on PancakeSwap, and exchanged 70k $ChickenFood on the V3 market for 34k $BUSD. Then, when the deposit of 340k was repaid, the attacker received a net profit of 31k $BUSD.
