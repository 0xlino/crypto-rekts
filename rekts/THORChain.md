According to ThorChainâ€™s preliminary incident report, the bug was located within the ETH Bifrost (bridge) code:  
https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/blob/develop/bifrost/pkg/chainclients/ethereum/ethereum_block_scanner.go#L794  
  


The code contains an over-ride loop, designed only for use in _vaultTransferEvent_ transactions, which the hacker was able to manipulate. The hacker was able to wrap the router with their own contract, allowing them to access this over-ride.  
  
The attacker drained liquidity in various coins:

\- 2,500 ETH

\- 57,975.33 SUSHI

\- 8.7365 YFI

\- 171,912.96 DODO

\- 514.519 ALCX

\- 1,167,216.739 KYL

\- 13.30 AAVE
