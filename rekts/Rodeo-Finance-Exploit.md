**Quick Summary**

Rodeo Finance, a Yield Protocol on Arbitrum, was exploited through an oracle issue causing a loss of 1,690,000 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Rodeo Finance was hit by an exploit resulting in a loss of approximately $880k stolen from the lending pool. Although the total impact was $1.7M, around $810k was recovered. The exploit occurred due to a sandwich attack on one of the oracles meant to be twap for Camelot's Uniswap v2 pools during its price update. This led to an inflation in the price, which enabled the hacker to borrow from the lending pool and swap all to the said token. The hacker arbitraged the DEX pool back to its normal price. The remaining ~810k left in the Rodeo farm used for the attack was subsequently recovered.
