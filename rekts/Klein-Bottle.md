**Quick Summary**

The $KLB token has been rugpulled by the token creator. The token creator deployed $KLB token and when the price of it went up the scammer exchanged tokens for $BNB dumping the price of $KLB.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

 _Klein Bottle's smart contract had never been published by the project deployer, https://bscscan.com/address/0x60930de2669670d1768108a77244f8ef56b4c544#code. This implicates that any investors intending to conduct due diligence and research on the source code would not have encountered any useful information. In simple terms, the project stood only on the grounds of promises made by the team, which could not be checked by investors since the source of code was not available to them_.

  


The creator of the $KLB token minted 100B $KLB tokens. (https://bscscan.com/tx/0x6d022790ad69a30e3f44022f5ca8da4583052dd541de4d41e0a41f814688d319).

After the creation of the price asset, 70% of the total supply was sent to this address (https://bscscan.com/token/0x60930de2669670d1768108a77244f8ef56b4c544?a=0x486844e15606aa9e4eb9b66fccf038404d7ec91b), where the tokens are located at the time of this writing. 13.8% were distributed among various scammer addresses. Perhaps an attempt to make the token distribution appear more normal. The below transactions show where funds have been sent:

Transfer transaction to address (A): https://bscscan.com/tx/0x2d97020d6751d01b7367c3266313642ae83e0054bca21a47833a9c9d4501a421  
Transfer transaction to address (B): https://bscscan.com/tx/0x6c26372cdbc781e09966b34a9242ec93d526a2b0f8d975ba0f3b3c607d654fea  
Transfer transaction to address (C): https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4f08766c87dcfa9ade917a5e097b89542c0e262069f52db6187da820442ca448

The address (A) created a liquidity pool between $BNB and $KLB. They waited until the token price became acceptable, then they started dumping the token price.
