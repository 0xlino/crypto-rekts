Further reports by PeckShield revealed that hackers transferred nearly 165,000 USDC to Binance and MEXC centralized exchanges. The Merlin team has released a post-mortem report stating that several members of the back-end team had drained all of their contracts, carried out on-chain transactions to drain all of Merlin's pools and manipulate front-end contracts.</p><p><br></p><p>According to the report, the back-end team implemented a function that allowed a call action to all Merlin pairs alongside hidden front-end contracts, draining all of Merlin's pools and the public sale. Merlin had submitted all intended contracts to be used on their platform to Certik for a full audit, but there was a clear oversight on the overarching power that the owner had of the pools. Furthermore, the back-end team, who also had access to Merlin's web-host, unknowingly manipulated the code to achieve their goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin's priority is to return all funds to affected parties and participants on their platform at the earliest opportunity. They are working alongside on-chain analysts to monitor the movement of the stolen funds and have notified relevant authorities in Serbia (region of the back-end team).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Wallet addresses of the contract owner/deployer: https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0xc0D6987d10430292A3ca994dd7A31E461eb28182, https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0xc7fD785f81Fe6bBb499009746a2BCbbdd895f5b0</p>",
