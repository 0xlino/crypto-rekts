    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>On January 3, 2023, a flash loan attack occurred on the GDS chain, resulting in a total loss of $187,000 and an 84% decline in the price of GDS currency.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The attacker, identified by their address as 0xcf2362, used a flash loan to borrow 2.38 million $USDT and traded 0.6 million $USDT for 3.4 million $GDS tokens using a pancake swap. The attacker then obtained a large amount of LP tokens using the remaining $1.7 million in USDT from the liquidity pool. There was a flaw in the \"_lpRewardAmount\" calculation function that the attacker misused to collect the profits from the $GDS token contract and then transfer the LP tokens to another contract 70 times to earn higher rewards until the flash loan was repaid.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker\u2019s address: https://bscscan.com/address/0xcf2362b46669e04b16d0780cf9b6e61c82de36a7</p><p>Attacker\u2019s transaction: https://bscscan.com/tx/0x2bb704e0d158594f7373ec6e53dc9da6c6639f269207da8dab883fc3b5bf6694</p><p>Attacker\u2019s remaining balance: https://bscscan.com/tokenholdings?a=0xcf2362b46669e04b16d0780cf9b6e61c82de36a7</p><p>GDS Pool closed after the attack: https://bscscan.com/tx/0x06d23624bd1edeb63665f41c4d3dd098d4c913a715c7b6fd9894575dcb0f43dc</p><p>10.3M $GDS tokens reward: 0x43b487c</p>",
