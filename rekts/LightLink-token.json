This resulted in a rapid drop in the token's price by approximately 90%. The deployer took advantage of their ability to manipulate the liquidity pool and market to execute a rug pull, effectively stealing funds from investors. The exploit highlights the importance of careful token contract design and the need for investors to perform due diligence before investing in new projects.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Deployer:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x04fe69039e57b1206f78dd9d077f4c3bf072cac1</p><p>Example TX of removing liquidity:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xef47fcb2036ea540edebc7d78e54c3c81547d3458d3785ae366e39b9bef737dd</p>",
