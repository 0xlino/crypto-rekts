**Quick Summary**

Level Finance was exploited, resulting in the loss of 214,000 $LVL tokens worth approximately 2,780,320 $USD. 

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Level Finance is a decentralized perpetual exchange running on the Binance Smart Chain. The project suffered an exploit that had targeted their Referral Controller Contract. The attacker could claim referral amounts as $LVL tokens multiple times by executing multiple transactions to drain the contract. As a result, 214k LVL tokens were drained from the contract and swapped for 3,345 $BNB which is equivalent to 1,097,160 $USD at current prices. All stolen funds remain controlled by the hacker who initiated this attack using the address: `0x61bb...412e` and holds them on another address: `0x7031...a9d5`. Fortunately, LPs and DAO treasury remained unaffected by this exploit since it was isolated from other contracts.
