 **Details of the Exploit**

RoeFinance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, recently suffered an attack resulting in the drain of its victim pool (0x574f) and a total loss of approximately $80K. This type of attack, known as price manipulation, was made possible by the limited liquidity of the pool, which led to the manipulation of the price oracle.

  


The attack involved the use of two addresses (0x67a9 and 0x3afb) and was carried out in 10 steps, resulting in a total profit of approximately $80K, or the equivalent of 2.29 WBTC and 39,982 USDC.

  


It's important to note that the original attack transaction can be found at https://etherscan.io/address/0x15d87dc2eb27fda26451f8fb04c576639104344d, which was front-run by a mev bot.
