Enigma, a decentralized platform that was preparing to raise money via a crypto token sale, had its website and a number of social accounts compromised with the perpetrators netting nearly $500,000 by sending out spam.  
  
Enigma, which was started by a group of MIT graduates, did not lose any money from the attack. Whoever orchestrated it grabbed money from the Enigma community, people who joined the company’s mailing list, or a Slack group of over 9,000 users to learn more about its ICO in September.  
  
The hacker posted Slack messages, altered the website, and spoofed emails to a community list that were made to look official and urged money to be sent to their crypto wallet.  
  
That’s netted the hacker 1,492 in Ether (worth $494,170.68), according to Etherscan:

Users on Reddit found that Enigma CEO Guy Zyskind’s email was accessed by the hacker. His email had been part of hacking of different services in the past and had been dumped on the internet, but seemingly Zyskind had not taken the time to change the password:
