The transaction behind the exploit:

NowSwap hack was made possible by an error when updating the smart contractâ€™s code.  The original code of the contract contained a value, K, of 1,000 in three different places.  The update to the code changed this value in two places but not the third.  
  
This third location was a check of the value of K, but it only checked for a value 1/10 of the actual value.  This enabled the attacker to swap 1 wei for 98% of the value stored in the contract.  
  
Stolen funds were deposited into Tornado Cash mixer:
