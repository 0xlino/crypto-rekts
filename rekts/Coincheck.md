**Quick Summary**

On Jan. 26, about 523 million NEM (XEM) tokens, valued at over $530 million at the time, were illicitly transferred from its hot wallet address, resulting in an anomalous drop in the Japanese exchange's balance.

 **  
Details of the Exploit**  
The attack was made possible by the company's technological issues and staff scarcity, which resulted in inadequate security measures. The stolen NEM were held on an internet-connected hot wallet rather than an offline cold wallet.  
  
Coincheck utilized its own funds to compensate all 260,000 impacted clients:
