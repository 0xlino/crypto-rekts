According to its own words the Teddy Doge project is one-stop full-featured decentralized exchange including a swap, aggregate transactions, liquidity and farms.

The token deployer minted 30m $Teddy token to the admin wallet on Jan 30, 2022 https://bscscan.com/tx/0x47bb88509aa68dd3cede68ec490bf80edfaf9c9724fe8c871cc0050bc2e75464

The admin wallet proceeded to transfer what would be worth 4,5m USD worth of $TEDDY token to hundreds of addresses.

Example of a wallet receiving funds (1) by the admin wallet and subsequently dumping (2) the $TEDDY on PancakeSwap in even smaller transactions:

At the end of the process, the funds, namely $BNB and $BUSD were aggregated in this wallet and slowly sold off on Binance.
