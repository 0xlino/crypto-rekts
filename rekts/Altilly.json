It was announced in 2019 that Altilly was acquired by the Qredit team.<br><br>While being in the phase of incorporation and acquiring the needed licenses to operate an exchange, Altilly got hacked in December 2020. Only a few months away from official company registration in Estonia.<br><br>The exchange lost its funds due to an attack on its servers. Since the hack, a lot of funds were lost, unsaved, or stolen.</p>",
