The attacker:  
\- took nine flash-swaps and added liquidity into the WBNB / BOG pool. Each flash-swap led to 47,770 BOG and the entire process consumed 88,159.43 WBNB with 83,440.57 LP tokens minted  
  
\- staked the minted 83,440.57 WBNB / BOG LP tokens into the BOG token contract for profit sharing  
  
\- performed 434 self-transfers in the total transfer amount of 18.74M BOG, resulting in an increased balance of 151K BOG  
  
\- sold the extra BOG on WBNB and then exchanged on anyETH  
  
\- removed the added liquidity in the first step and completed the flash-swaps.
