Hackers launched a phishing attack targeting users of the Ledger hardware wallet.  
  
The attackers allegedly sent Ledger users an email informing them that their wallets had been hacked in a security breach impacting thousands of users. They stated that the incident occurred on October 24 and that the Ledger security team is unable to estimate the extent of user harm.  
  
"In order to protect your assets, please download the latest version of Ledger Live and follow the instructions to set up a new PIN to your wallet," the email said. The user is then sent to a download link on a bogus website designed to steal the user's credentials.
