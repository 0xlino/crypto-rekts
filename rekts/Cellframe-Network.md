**Quick Summary**

Cellframe Network ($CELL) experienced a flash loan exploit on the Binance Smart Chain, resulting in a loss of 76,112 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

CELL is a community BEP20 token of the Cellframe Network, trading on PancakeSwap. On June 1st, 2023, Cellframe Network was exploited via a flash loan attack that caused the price to drop -45%. The attacker successfully obtained a profit of 245.52 $BNB and approximately $76,112 USD. The exploit occurred due to an unverified source code deployed by the attacker in a single transaction.

The exploiter took out a flashloan from the DPP project and drained funds from PancakeV3Pool. All stolen assets were transferred to another EOA address where they currently remain.

The source of the problem is a smart contract that migrated old liquidity to new without taking into account changing spread between them during migration.
