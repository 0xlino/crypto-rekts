Anti-scam vigilance War on Rugs, a self-described collection of smart contract auditors and blockchain developers, offered itself as a resource for verifying the credentials of a DeFi project, warning of projects it deemed insecure.  
  
Later, War or Rugs created their own token - Fairmoon, which is the clone of the Safemoon. After the token launch, some insider wallets bought FAIRMOON before War on Rugs audit on some over $40k, which later were dumped and brought $1,800,00 of profit:

To calm down the community, the project announced migration to a new token. However, Shappy aka WarOnRugs completed his 2nd exit scam and again ran away with at least 1,170 BNB ($500,000 at this point). The total amount by which the community was defrauded thus amounts to at least $2,300,000.
