This platform allows users to stake NFT tokens to receive fungible tokens e.g. $ETH. The attacker deposited NFTs from the collection Doodles that were used as a collateral to borrow $WETH. Then the attacker exploited a vulnerability in order to execute a reentrancy attack by withdrawing all NFTs deposited as collateral by the attacker except for one NFT. This action triggered a malicious callback function that allowed the attacker to buy more Doodles before <span data-v-046f6c7b=\"\">&nbsp;liquidating the loan position:&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\"><span data-v-046f6c7b=\"\">https://etherscan.io/tx/0x05d65e0adddc5d9ccfe6cd65be4a7899ebcb6e5ec7a39787971bcc3d6ba73996</span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\"><span data-v-046f6c7b=\"\">When the position is liquidated, the remaining Doodle NFT from the collateral were returned to the&nbsp;</span>attacker. The credit position is liquidated because NFT value from initial collateral is insufficient to cover the debt position. A<span data-v-046f6c7b=\"\">s the attacker is able to force through using the borrowed WETH to buy more NFTs before the liquidation occurs. As a result, the money received from the attack was withdrawn through Tornado.cash.</span></p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\"><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Attacker account address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x627a22ff70cb84e74c9c70e2d5b0b75af5a1dcb9</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Attacker contract address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5992f10a5b284be845947a1ae1694f8560a89fa8</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Contract creations transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x193016ce1ed6c7ec6377efd89309f7415c21190619b8e1fe625a6cdcca4f5ba5</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Exploited smart contract address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8</p>",
