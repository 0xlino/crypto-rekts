**Quick Summary**

Multichain, a crosschain bridge, was exploited leading to an estimated loss of 231,000,000 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Cross-chain Bridge Multichain faced an exploit resulting in nearly $130 million being siphoned out of various token bridges. The assets locked up in the Multichain MPC address were moved abnormally to an EOA address. The unexpected outflows led to Multichain’s Fantom Bridge losing its entire holdings in wBTC, USDC, USDT, and a handful of altcoins, worth over $130 million in total. Similar outflows were observed from Multichain’s Moonriver and Dogecoin bridge contracts. The assets transferred out of the Multichain Fantom bridge include DAI, LINK, USDT, wBTC, wETH, and USDC. Multichain team announced the team is not sure what happened. The most possible cause of the exploit is wallet compromise, but there is also the possibility of an insider hack.
