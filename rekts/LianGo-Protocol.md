**Quick Summary**

LianGo Protocol was exploited via access control. The attacker compromised private keys and was able to receive $LGT tokens from the project's pool for roughly 1,600,000 $USD

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

LianGo Protocol is a decentralized consume-as-mine payment protocol. The project has multiple contracts such as $LGT token contract and LGT Pool. The deployer address of the protocol was compromised, which allowed the exploiter to add a malicious pool to the Pool contract, and drain $LGT tokens worth about 1,600,000 $USD. The stolen tokens were sold on the PancakeSwap which affected the $LGT token price, which has dropped 97%.
