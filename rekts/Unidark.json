    "description": "<p>The project team announced an airdrop as well as a token sale. They used Telegram to spread phony Vitalik Buterin statements about their token in order to boost the trust. The contract deployer with malicious rights called a function named <u>clearETH()</u>, which allowed him to transfer ETH to his own address. As a result, 85.1 ETH was withdrawn from the token contract. Users contacted Binance's technical support. In the end, the address of the deployer was frozen on the exchange.<br><br>The transaction where the mentioned function was invoked:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfa04a396f9fc06b4d1a7a01382dde92e488e268759af348e680d7a1ca8bda75a</p>",
