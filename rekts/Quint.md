**Quick Summary**

The Quint project was attacked by hackers in the amount of $130K. The attacker took advantage of the vulnerability, thanks to which he was able to withdraw his rewards again.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Quint is a stacking and farming platform where users can stake $QUINT at low transaction fees while enjoying the rewards in the form of a variety of tokens.

The attack occurred due to a vulnerability in the contract called by the _reStake()  _function. When this function is performed, the reward time in LP tokens is not updated, as a result an attacker can claim the issued rewards several times.
