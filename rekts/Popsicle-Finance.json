    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>Popsicle Finance suffered an exploit due to a bug in the collectFees() function, allowing the attacker to withdraw rewards without holding PLP tokens. The attacker stole a total of 2.56K WETH, 96.2 WBTC, 160K DAI, 5.39M USDC, 4.98M USDT, and 10.5K UNI.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The attacker created three contracts, one of which was used to launch the attack, while the other two were used to invoke the collectFees() function to fetch the rewards. The attacker utilized a Flash Loan from AAVE and launched the Deposit-Withdraw-CollectFees cycle to perform the attack. There were 8 cycles in total, and a significant amount of liquidity was withdrawn from multiple vaults of Popsicle Finance. After the attack, the stolen funds were deposited into the Tornado Cash mixer.</p><p><br></p><p>Stolen funds:<br>- 2.56K WETH<br>- 96.2 WBTC<br>- 160K DAI<br>- 5.39M USDC<br>- 4.98M USDT<br>- 10.5K UNI</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The attacker's address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xf9e3d08196f76f5078882d98941b71c0884bea52</p><p><br></p><p>The transaction behind the attack:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcd7dae143a4c0223349c16237ce4cd7696b1638d116a72755231ede872ab70fc</p><p><br></p><p>The transaction list of the stolen funds:</p><p>https://bloxy.info/txs/transfers_from/0xf9e3d08196f76f5078882d98941b71c0884bea52?currency_id=1</p>",
