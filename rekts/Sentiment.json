The attacker used a view re-entrancy Balancer bug to execute malicious code before pool balances were updated and steal money using overpriced collateral. The attack involved several steps:</p><p>1. Attacker took a flashloan.</p><p>2. Attacker significantly changed rates.</p><p>3. Attacker called \"exitPool\" function and executed hack when balancer sent assets to its contract.</p><p>4. Sentiment contracts were called before PoolBalancesChanged emitted by balancer smart contract.</p><p>5. Hacker could manipulate these values to overprice their collateral and then borrow and withdraw sentiment pool assets.</p><p><br></p><p>The exact amount lost due to this exploit reached 968,279 $USD in total, including 538,399 $USDC, 360,000 $USDT, 0.51 $WBTC and 29.97 $WETH.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd0cDb4c3b887bc533957BC32463977E432e49C3</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa9ff2b587e2741575daf893864710a5cbb44bb64ccdc487a100fa20741e0f74d</p>",
