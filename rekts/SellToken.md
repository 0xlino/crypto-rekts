**Quick Summary**

SellToken, a Binance Smart Chain DEX, was exploited, leading to a loss of 12,000,000 $SELLC worth approximately 105,270 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

An exploiter took a flashloan of 620 $BNB and performed malicious actions involving the Miner contract and PancakeSwap pool. They exploited a logic issue in the sendMiner() function of the Miner contract, stealing over 12,000,000 $SELLC tokens. These were then swapped for 446 $BNB, worth around 105,270 $USD. All the stolen funds were transferred to another externally owned account (EOA) and subsequently swapped for $USDT.
