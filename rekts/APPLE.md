**Quick Summary**

On March 19, 2023, the team behind the APPLE Token token executed a rug pull, resulting in a loss of funds worth $30k USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The attack on the APPLE Token token involved the token contract deployer manipulating the liquidity pool by removing liquidity from the pair contract and selling a large quantity of tokens on the market. This resulted in a rapid drop in the token's price by approximately 90%.

The exploit highlights the importance of careful token contract design and the need for investors to perform due diligence before investing in new projects.
