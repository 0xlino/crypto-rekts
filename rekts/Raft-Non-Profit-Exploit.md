**Quick Summary**

Raft lending platform was exploited due to a precision calculation issue, resulting in a loss of 3,304,406 USD worth 1575.67 ETH.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Raft is a lending and borrowing platform that runs R stablecoin. On November 10, 2023, a precision calculation issue was exploited, allowing the attacker to mint ~$6.7 million unbacked R and sell R, causing R's depeg. The attacker borrowed 6,000 cbETH from AAVE via a flash loan and exploited the divUp function's behavior to mint extra share tokens. They then redeemed a nominal amount of rcbETH-c for a significant quantity of cbETH and borrowed substantial amounts of R. The attacker swapped the minted R for 1575 ETH, but burned 1,570 ETH, resulting in a loss of 3,304,406 USD worth 1575.67 ETH for the project.
