**Quick Summary**

The OMNI Real Estate Token (ORT) protocol was exploited using smart contract vulnerability approximately for $70k USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The key to the attack was insufficient argument validation and imperfection of calculations in the StakingPool contract.  In this case function _check_Reward returns the wrong output amount and led to the unfair ORT rewards distribution. Then ORT tokens were swapper to BNB.  The attacker's profit is approximately 236BNB.
