**Quick Summary**

Cryptsy lost 13,000 BTC and 300,000 LTC due to an IRC backdoor in the code of the Lucky7Coin wallet.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The developer of Lucky7Coin had inserted an IRC backdoor into the wallet's code, which functioned as a Trojan or command and control unit. This Trojan had likely been present for several months, gathering enough information to execute the attack. Cryptsy was alerted of a decrease in their safe/cold wallet balances of Bitcoin and Litecoin, as well as a few other minor cryptocurrencies, leading to the discovery of the exploit.
