**Quick Summary**

Banana Swap was exploited for the total amount of 110,105 in $BUSD due to contract vulnerability. 

 **  
Details of the Exploit**

Banana Swap is a simple DEX intended for trading the $DDC token. Due to security issues of the project's smart contracts, an attacker was able to manipulate the price of the $DDC token. The attacker used a contract function to manipulate the internal price of $DDC. The attacker broke the price calculation mechanism in the project's contract. The attacker swapped 23 $DDC for 110,105 $BUSD using a malicious smart contract. Consequently, stolen assets were distributed between 3 team-related EOA addresses.
