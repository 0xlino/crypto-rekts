    "description": "<p>Following the previous exit scam case, the project announced a relaunch with a new token $xDEF2 and a new approach. The new smart contracts have a pause mechanism that allows owner to whitelist specific addresses. Furthermore, there is a ban option that allows limiting specific addresses as well. An EOA wallet owns both of these functionalities, which can be accessed at any moment. There is no traditional rebase function. Instead, there's the mint function, which can be invoked at any time by the contract owner.</p>",
