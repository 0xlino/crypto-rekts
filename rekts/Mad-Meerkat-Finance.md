On May 4, 2022, the front-end of the MM Finance protocol was hacked, which allowed the hacker to change the router address and redirect all the funds of users who somehow interacted with the protocol through the front-end to their wallet. 

The exploit lasted approximately three hours, then the team turned off the front-end. 

Team members advised users on Discord not to interact with the site.
