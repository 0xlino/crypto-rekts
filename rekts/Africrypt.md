**Quick Summary**

Ameer and Raees Cajee, the exchange's founders, were reported missing in June 2021 after alleging that almost $3.6 billion invested in the protocol was stolen in a "hack".

  


  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Africrypt claimed to connect banks, payment providers and digital asset providers for seamless global money transfers.

  


In April 2021, the Africrypt case gained traction. At the time, one of the protocol's founders contacted investors to notify them that the protocol had been compromised. The creator asked that investors refrain from contacting attorneys or law authorities since doing so would "slow the recovery process."

  


However, Africrypt staff lost access to the exchange's back-end systems seven days before the claimed attack, making this report suspect. After receiving notice of the "hack" and its odd request not to contact attorneys or law enforcement, several investors hired a law firm Hanekom Attorneys. The investigation discovered that most of the bitcoin invested with the exchange had been withdrawn and moved through tumblers and mixers to make it harder to track. 

  


  


The founders of Africrypt are still at large and have not been found as the time of this writing.
