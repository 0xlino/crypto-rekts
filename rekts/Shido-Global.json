The attacker initially took a flash loan of 40 $BNB and swapped it to obtain a large amount of Shido tokens. Then, the attacker exploited a flaw in the ShidoLock contract that allowed them to convert v1 tokens to v2 tokens at a large scale. Finally, the exploiter swapped these tokens for 1,016 WBNB, repaid the flash loan, and made away with a profit of roughly 977 $BNB which is worth $235,458 USD. The stolen funds were transferred through Celer Bridge.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker Address:&nbsp;</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x69810917928b80636178b1bb011c746efe61770d</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Contract Address:&nbsp;</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xcdb3d057ca0cfdf630baf3f90e9045ddeb9ea4cc</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transaction:&nbsp;</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x72f8dd2bcfe2c9fbf0d933678170417802ac8a0d8995ff9a56bfbabe3aa712d6</p><p><br></p><p>Bridging Transactions:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x2de117d308f7f001bf3dad70cce6347c8cf26f254d7ee68cbf14370bc8c8c99f</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x2a1b7601f4a5960cca232e3d1abdca89a34b02948b79b59ac07f18edaacc69bb</p>",
