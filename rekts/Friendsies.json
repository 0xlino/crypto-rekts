The project had been criticized by community members for deviating from its initial roadmap, with several aspects remaining undelivered, including a community treasury and a play-to-earn game. On-chain sleuth ZackXBT also revealed that the project's founders had not distributed 1.25% of all royalties to holders, as claimed in the project's official Discord server.</p><p><br></p>",
