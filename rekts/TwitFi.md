**Quick Summary**

The TwitFi token was exploited resulting in a significant amount of ETH being taken due to a miscalculation by the off-chain validator.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The TwitFi token (TWT) has fallen victim to exploitation, leading to a loss of approximately 87 ETH ($137.3k), as the exploiter took advantage of the transfer function to send the tokens to the Reward Contract. Subsequently, the off-chain validator erroneously calculated the claimReward() amount, which the exploiter exploited further by calling the function and transferring the tokens before creating a new EOA and ultimately liquidating all the tokens.
