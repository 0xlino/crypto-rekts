They then used these stablecoins to mint OUSD from the Origin Protocol's vault. The attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in the mint function of the OUSD contract to mint more OUSD than the equivalent stablecoin collateral in the vault. This resulted in the attacker holding more OUSD than the total value in the vault. The attacker then exchanged the excess OUSD for USDT and DAI on Uniswap and SushiSwap, and withdrew the remaining stablecoins from the OUSD vault. Finally, the attacker returned the borrowed ETH to dYdX and transferred the stolen funds to their account.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>The attacker's address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xb77f7bbac3264ae7abc8aedf2ec5f4e7ca079f83</p><p>The transaction behind the attack:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe1c76241dda7c5fcf1988454c621142495640e708e3f8377982f55f8cf2a8401</p><p>The contract deployed at:</p><p>https://www.contract-library.com/contracts/Ethereum/0x47c3d84394043a4f42f6422accd27bb7240fdfe2</p><p><br>- 1,000,000 DAI was transferred to the attacker\u2019s account<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8c0459b68555129502a88619df3c89428ba89451f2758f388884192cbe84cd95<br><br>- 1,138,449.12 OUSD was redeemed for a mix of stablecoins<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xae6bee2824afe1b0552f2127fb3f124b31adac554e04dba8231fffe4ea83f6bb<br><br>- 531,688.76 OUSD was redeemed for a mix of stablecoins<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa990fe2c4ea7afd6497032a57f005a4d2ba2db1acb044ffa955615d6a126538f<br><br>- 248,059.48 OUSD was redeemed for a mix of stablecoins<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe95b4d3df0a73728cd0d0c32dfb2b41625e6946ac466e055d2fd18fa62c14e55<br><br>- 543,305.34 USDT and 226,832.53 USDC were converted to ETH on Uniswap and transferred to the attacker\u2019s account along with 1,128,244.36 DAI<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x49d59b45031aa90aa6a096e3e2a6171fa7f5b4882ea9ac997fd64911b6f33aec<br><br>- 115,732.21 OUSD was redeemed for a mix of stablecoins<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcff80ddd8576e19e23116aaacdf37147b9eaa69103bc8dc8b0602aee2fc089b4<br><br>- 53,994.89 OUSD was redeemed for a mix of stablecoins<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47e515d55b4c52302c184cb9323a9e110f37d54ba79d6190756fd7c850847343<br><br>- 300,000.00 OUSD was exchanged for 60,505.30 USDT on Uniswap</p><p>1,000,000.00 OUSD was exchanged for 187,152.67 USDT on SushiSwap<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8a1907dbf0f687524e6e7869000e1ef5b34d937741a3160611d42e15c8d76b15<br><br>- 25,191.33 OUSD was redeemed for a mix of stablecoins<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf14f4158fcbb5ff1e32638bed7ea0d80848a34d4c228a5477113ab58913633d9<br><br>- 300,000.00 OUSD was exchanged for 29,803.08 USDT on Uniswap</p><p>1,000,000.00 OUSD was exchanged for 98,401.29 USDT on SushiSwap<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8eba96d3f5851f4d4f703c40fb58effaca1211660b2a96aafd50e3587f3a29e7<br><br>- 11,616.27 OUSD was redeemed for a mix of stablecoins<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9a133457d88a79d539cda2353e24c45ed55817da244abe77fefbb0e0d6af0383<br><br>- 434,407.95 USDT and 24,443.08 USDC were converted to ETH on Uniswap and transferred to the attacker\u2019s account along with 121,577.54 DAI<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7db4e34811371ff2862fb2532d2d401904bd98917878c27828d4826027ffc45e<br><br>- 498,487.66 OUSD was transferred back to the deployer of the OUSD contract (Origin Protocol)<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2c9d20292e5a0edccf9e5713819934161520db0b02aee90f719bd64899ba211f</p>",
