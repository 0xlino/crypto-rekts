    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>Cashio protocol was exploited due to incorrect collateral validation during minting, which has led to infinite minting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong><br>The validation of the LP tokens is to be deposited via the <u>saber_swap.arrow</u> (USDT-USDC LP) is incomplete, as the mint field is never validated. As a consequence, the hacker was able to deploy a bogus contract that was never verified, followed by a chain of bogus accounts that all passed validation since they were only compared to one another.</p><p><br>In addition, in order to pass the <u>common collateral</u> verification, the hacker created a fake bank and was able to instruct the program to mint the original $CASH token because there was no check that the bank's token matched the one being minted.</p><p><br></p><p>After these actions, the hacker minted 2 billion $CASH tokens, and the part of $CASH was burnt to SaberLPTokens. Then another part of the tokens was withdrawn out to $UST and $USDC. The remaining $CASH was swapped for 8,600,000 $UST and 17,000,000 $USDC. Most of the stolen funds were bridged to Ethereum address. </p><p><br></p><p>The hacker left the message in the transaction \"Account with less than 100k have been returned. All other money will be donated to charity.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>The hacker's address:<br>https://solscan.io/account/6D7fgzpPZXtDB6Zqg3xRwfbohzerbytB2U5pFchnVuzw</p><p><br></p><p>Validation transaction:<br>https://solscan.io/tx/3t1zqtKk4CgCk5ZDZMGSwdfvvWPekyQ5r8Prhk9MiR5Sw8vujCnFBncAuFCttw3oXzacMRH9ud3VY5virUY2Z39y</p><p><br></p><p>Mint transaction:</p><p>https://solscan.io/tx/2X1TKidhbocN5HRLVWRUk8W1YSQH9b6VH7biAm1ad5jwTZNrPSxajz2cyorrvqtUbWUAmCb52Yqk8VxYF2P6H5tP</p><p><br>Burning to SaberLPTokens transaction:<br>https://solscan.io/tx/4g5okypEDK9xdDwcootYz86uzTXm41VX7WosiJETGisiG2XpvNgT59djDiD2vwstQtCFF9bqSnViYJGF9Z9QrUvV<br><br>Withdraw transaction:<br>https://solscan.io/tx/pjUgAeUfWaSSJuw2Cq1cQ9gHNWs8jkxJMtHqVAMuwhg3Uk9LN9Y2obfwt6Qm8bztg56xidWBMytzmqyWzvbsrwH<br><br>Ethereum address funds were sent:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0x86766247ba3405c5f15f06b895294200809e9cfb</p><p>The message hacker left:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa8394d2e55042f84d096c72dd1075fa2648faf88e248c7992273b4d50a6a647b</p>",
