Iron.Finance team was unaware of the change and updated Iron vFarm pools with reward rate in Gwei. This caused the pools' rewards to inflated by 10^18 times.<br><br>The following address took advantage of the mistake and drained all SIL rewards and sold them to the market:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x69655181a55755adc854cd35c15995393f63e9e5#tokentxns</p>",
