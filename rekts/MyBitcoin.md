Because of the weak password storage system at Mt. Gox, users who used the same password for both MyBitcoin and Mt. Gox were infiltrated and significant amounts of assets were lost there too. By MyBitcoin's estimation, about 1% of all users were affected by the security breach/ incident/ illegal hack.
