**Quick Summary**

Arcadia Finance, a decentralized trading platform, was exploited through reentrancy on both Ethereum and Optimism, losing 459,094 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Arcadia Finance, a DEX on Ethereum and Optimism chain was exploited due to a code vulnerability leading to the loss of funds on both Ethereum and Optimism chains. The hacker utilized a loophole in the code which lacked proper validation of untrusted input, draining assets from Ethereum (darcWETH) and Optimism (darcUSDC) vaults. The exploit resulted in a loss of 459,094 $USD in total, of which 159.22 $ETH and 162,627 $USDC were lost. 103,200 $USDC and 11 $ETH were lost from the Ethereum chain, while 59,427 $USDC and 148.22 $ETH were lost from the Optimism chain. Funds on the Ethereum chain were swapped for $ETH and $DAI and remained at the attacker's address, while the Optimism chain funds were swapped for $ETH and then bridged through Stargate Finance.
