    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>Safe Wallet (formerly Gnosis Safe) on Ethereum was exploited due to an approval-related issue, resulting in a loss of 283,828 $USD from the user's wallet in various tokens.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>Between August 12 and August 13, 2023, Safe Wallet, a DeFi wallet on the Ethereum chain, was exploited by three attackers in three separate transactions. The attackers discovered an approval-related flaw that allowed them to steal various tokens including WBTC, PEPE, USDT, WETH, and CRV. The issue appears to be approval-related and the attack vector was the same across the three hacks, but the implementation differed. The total loss from these exploits amounts to approximately 283,828 $USD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attackers:</p><p>- https://etherscan.com/address/0xb9c77db3C0e1254D073E65dc0455ba6DDd3ce385</p><p>- https://etherscan.com/address/0x38F887a0FE01b9e4960D5C727519408fA7f32F70</p><p>- https://etherscan.com/address/0x7d9bC45a9ABDA926A7Ce63f78759dBFA9Ed72e26</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transactions:</p><p>- https://etherscan.com/tx/0x31f9d94d2587ee535ae3393839b1c72e8ddd11cf92f1a3a90359bcdb0f3962b9</p><p>- https://etherscan.com/tx/0x5706654a2412dee256a5688a929be8edd07f0e2a897ac574bea06fe846843eaa</p><p>- https://etherscan.com/tx/0x7b675b1d5be88dd25ac998b8f4f0ae044f654e5089fd1e566aa06858b6ad96e0</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Contract Addresses:</p><p>- https://etherscan.com/address/0x965a3A6016c2EDf0605a2B1C38c7159b495c0573</p><p>- https://etherscan.com/address/0xA1038f644389C04318156D54E40679b98B686838</p><p>- https://etherscan.com/address/0xabB8cDD69F76cFd779D18adEC982F898bfefe680</p>",
