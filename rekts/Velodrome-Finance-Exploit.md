**Quick Summary**

Velodrome DEX on Optimism chain was exploited due to a DNS attack, resulting in a loss of 42,000 USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Velodrome, a decentralized trading protocol on the Optimism chain, experienced a DNS attack on November 29, 2023. The frontend was compromised, and users were urged not to interact with the platform. The Velodrome team regained control of their domain after a social engineering attack on their provider. However, the provider was exploited again, and the frontend was compromised a second time. The domain was eventually restored and locked at the TLD level. The stolen funds, totaling 42,000 USD, were distributed among multiple addresses and deposited into KuCoin.
