 **Details of the Exploit**

Jaypeggerz ($JAY) is an ERC-20 token trading on Uniswap. Jaypeggerz experienced a flash loan exploit. The attacker borrowed $ETH from Balancer using their smart contract and used it 

to manipulate the price of $JAY tokens on Uniswap by buying them up at low prices and selling them back at inflated prices. The attacker then returned the borrowed funds after completing these transactions.

The exploiter appears to have gained 15.32 $ETH, which were sent to TornadoCash and Aztec Network for anonymity purposes.
