This enabled us to mitigate the financial damages of the hack, reducing a potential $800,000 loss into a $38,000 loss. All the funds recovered from the emergency actions we took were added back as liquidity on PancakeSwap, and all liquidity providers were recompensed directly to their wallets.\"</p>",
