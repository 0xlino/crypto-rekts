    "description": "<p>The owner of the bitcoin betting site Just-Dice, a rival to SatoshiDice, had a severe moment of panic when a user taking advantage of a human error caused him to lose 1,300 bitcoins (around $116,090 at the time of writing).<br><br>Known only as \u2018dooglus\u2019, the owner revealed on the Bitcoin Talk forum that he had made something of a colossal mistake. What happened was this: a player won a load of bitcoins on the site and asked to withdraw them, dooglus paid out, but forgot to remove the balance from the user\u2019s Just-Dice account. The user then gambled \u2014 and lost \u2014 the bitcoins that were left in his account and dooglus covered the loss out of his own pocket.<br><br>When he realized his mistake, dooglus contacted the user, who claimed he had left his laptop in a caf\u00e9 and that someone else logged onto his Just-Dice account and gambled the money.</p>",
