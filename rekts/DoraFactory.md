ChainSwap was cracked by the hacker. DORA tokens on ChainSwap bridges were affected. 7872 DORA tokens were stolen from the ChainSwap bridge smart contract and they were immediately sold on Uniswap.  
  
Most of the tokens were assets owned by the Foundation, and they were used to create cross-chain liquidities.
