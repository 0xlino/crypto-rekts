**Quick Summary**

BNQ token was rug pulled by the token deployer-related address. The malicious actors sold 152,505,402 $BNQ, which leads to a price drop by more than 90%

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

BNQ token is a copycat BEP20 token and is not related to other projects with the same token symbol. An EOA address started selling $BNQ tokens on PancakeSwap after receiving the tokens from the token deployer-related address and drained 255,675 $USD worth of assets. Consequently, stolen funds were transferred to another EOA address, which added liquidity to another pool with $BNQ tokens and the stolen $BUSD.
