Czech Republic-based bitcoin exchange Bitcash.cz has been hacked and up to 4,000 customers’ wallets have been emptied.  
  
According to Czech news site E15.cz, some 4,000 bitcoin wallets had been opened with Bitcash.cz, with a total value of over 2 million Czech koruna (roughly equivalent to $100,000).  
  
A post on the company's Facebook page reads:

"Unfortunately, as we have already announced on our website Bitcash.cz, our server was attacked and compromised – including the wallets.  
  
We are trying to resolve the situation, but we want to warn our users about fraudulent emails and scams [claiming to be from Bitcash].  
  
We never ask anyone for access to his or her accounts or wallets nor ask for money.  
  
We will inform you of any developments as soon as possible.  
  
Thanks."
