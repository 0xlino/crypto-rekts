The attacker took 45 $BNB.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>Alexa Project is a BEP20 token trading on PancakeSwap. The token $ALEXA was listed on the DEX on 1st March 2023. After a few days, the project was exploited due to smart contract logic issue. The attacker was able to exploit the token's smart contract interaction with PancakePair, which allowed the malicious actor to gain 45.43 $WBNB which is worth 13,256 $USD at the moment. Liquidity was totally removed using a malicious smart contract with unverified source code. The stolen funds were transferred through several EOA addresses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x3bec7fe6bec50610af4a8afd7c7cbb0e002f41ce</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x669c98b1bb5f9ab84593875a92f7e680ef0411f053f6ed91ef84a91abf167be5</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x9171a1d4d38a2e664ebff9db9759d9f9177f9ba2</p>",
