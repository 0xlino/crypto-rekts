**Quick Summary**

Hope Finance was rugpulled, with the scammer making off with approximately 1,860,000 $USD worth of $ETH 

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Hope Finance is DeFi protocol on the Arbitrum layer-2 chain. The protocol launched an algorithmic token $HOPE pegged to $ETH. The Hope ecosystem contains $HOPE, $DREAM, and $WISH tokens. The protocol was rugpulled by an EOA address that used a multisig wallet to modify the TradingHelper contract's router, so when SwapWETH sends the funds directly to the attacker's address instead of performing a normal swap. The attacker drained 1,095 $ETH which is worth approximately 1,860,000 $USD. All the stolen funds were transferred to the Ethereum chain through Celer and UniSwap and then to Tornado Cash using three addresses.

According to the project's official Twitter, the possible scammer was identified as Ugwoke Pascal Chukwuebuka, also the photo with the ID of the scammer was published in the same tweet.

Web3 Security company Cognitos had audited Hope Finance's smart contracts. Cognitos reported that audited smart contracts and deployed ones are not the same.
