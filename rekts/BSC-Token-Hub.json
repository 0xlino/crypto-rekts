The hacker used a low-level proof vulnerability and minted 2,000,000 $BNB to their address. Consequently, the hacker began bridging the funds to Fantom and Ethereum chains. The security experts in collaboration with validators were able to save the majority of the funds. The hacker managed to bridge 127,000,000 $USD using AnySwap and Stargate bridges, with 53% of the stolen funds going to Ethereum, 33% to Fantom, and the rest to other chains. Tether blacklisted the attacker's address. The remaining 459,000,000 $USD worth of assets were left frozen in the attacker's address.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x489a8756c18c0b8b24ec2a2b9ff3d4d447f79bec</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transactions:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x05356fd06ce56a9ec5b4eaf9c075abd740cae4c21eab1676440ab5cd2fe5c57a</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xebf83628ba893d35b496121fb8201666b8e09f3cbadf0e269162baa72efe3b8b</p><p><br></p><p>Affected contracts:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002000</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001004</p>",
