    "description": "<p>On July 10, 2020, one of the OTC Transaction managers in East Delhi, India, was involved in an incident. On the 8th of July 2020, the employee reported a machine malfunction with the systems provided to him by the company. As a result, he requested to work from his own computer and created many alternative online wallets on platforms like Blockchain.com, Huobi, and others. The team made an exception and authorized him to do so while keeping the current OTC deals/transactions in mind.<br><br>Hackers gained access to the employee's PC while active browser sessions were open. The hackers employed a number of methods, including phishing, malware, and other attacks. The Bitcoins were sent to 14RYUUaMW1shoxCav4znEh64xnTtL3a2Ek, from where they are being distributed to other wallets:<br>https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/14RYUUaMW1shoxCav4znEh64xnTtL3a2Ek</p>",
