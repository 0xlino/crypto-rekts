**

 **Details of the Exploit**

A hacker posted a fraudulent link to a clone of the BAYC website with a fake airdrop, prompting users to sign a 'safeTransferFrom' transaction. As a result, their assets were transferred to the scammer's wallet. The stolen Apes, based on the most recent sale price, are valued well into the six figures. The total worth of the four stolen Apes is well over $1 million. The scammer sold the NFTs mostly on LooksRare and accumulated a total net worth of 765 ETH, which were then transferred to an external wallet.
