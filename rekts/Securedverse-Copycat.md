**Quick Summary**

Securedverse copycat project was rugpulled, resulting in a loss of 131,133 $USD due to liquidity removal by a deployer-related EOA.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Securedverse (SVC), a BEP20 token, became a victim of a rugpull executed by a related scammer. Initially, the deployer transferred 500,000,000 $SVC tokens to a distinct address that subsequently added the tokens to the PancakeSwap pool. After a day, this liquidity was removed and the pool was drained entirely by the scammer, allowing them to gain a profit of 131,133 $USD in $BNB. The stolen funds currently reside in the scammer's address. Please note, Securedverse is a clone project and should not be confused with the original.
