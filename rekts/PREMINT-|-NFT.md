 **Details of the Exploit**

PREMINT is an NFT service intended to help project creators build access lists for new NFT projects based on various qualifications.

The PREMINT's platform website was attacked by a hacker utilizing a malicious JavaScript code.

When users tried to log into the platform, they instead signed over all approvals of their wallet to the attacker. The attacker proceeded to exploit affected wallets and send NFTs out of famous collections such as Murakami.Flowers, Kaiju Kingz and Azuki to a variety of his own wallets. Below a number of transaction made by the attacker:
