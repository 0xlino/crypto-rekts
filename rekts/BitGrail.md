**Quick Summary**

The BitGrail Operator may have hacked own crypto exchange to steal 120,000,000 $USD

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The exchange was attacked by hackers in January-February 2018, as a result, 17 million Nano (NANO) tokens were stolen, worth between $146 million. Italian police have alleged a 34-year-old man from Florence, known as FF, is thought to be behind the theft from the exchange, which saw the company collapse into bankruptcy with significant losses for its users.  
  
230,000 account holders at BitGrail were affected in the attack, which honed in on the platformâ€™s reserves of Nano cryptocurrency. FF is thought to have been responsible, or to have taken no action to prevent the attack and the losses which resulted from it.
