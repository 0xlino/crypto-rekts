The contract deployer transferred tokens to the external wallet at:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x08779ce4a35d90939861e08fc470cdaf7bf946fb9fe2bddb4025f364fda805ec<br><br>2. The token recipient added initial and further liquidity at:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcff977ee5e3184b1eb6d5a9b8710a28638a245b54fdf968c3c22d26ffa816858<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb97cfbb3d5554cb05a92c43aa2f365add857ca90290a9f56aebf6ad41d1074bf<br><br>3. Only 18.23 / 304 ETH was used to add liquidity. In addition, the token was listed on the Hotbit exchange:<br>https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060184974-Hotbit-will-launch-CUBIC-Cubic-Finance-on-January-15th-2021<br><br>4. The token recipient from step 2 transferred part of tokens to the other external wallet at:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x84c16aa10d55e3b1522be74bc13dc2d81fabd78d08a8a3411fb429d1d04ac41c<br><br>5. This external wallet deposited received tokens directly to the Hotbit exchange so further actions can't be tracked. Stolen funds were calculated based on the raised funds from the presale event minus added liquidity amount.</p>",
