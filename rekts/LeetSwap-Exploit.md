**Quick Summary**

LeetSwap, an AMM-based DEX on Base chain, was exploited, resulting in a loss of 342.56 ETH worth 628,583 USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

On Aug 01, 2023, LeetSwap's AMM-based DEX running on Base chain was exploited. The attacker executed a sequence of malicious actions that allowed them to steal funds from the protocol. The steps involved:

1\. Swapping a small amount of WETH for X tokens (a transaction that should have incurred fees).

2\. Calling _transferFeesSupportingTaxTokens(address, uint256) to move the token to a Fees contract.

3\. Calling sync().

4\. Swapping X tokens for all the WETH from the pool.

  


As a result of these actions, approximately 342.56 ETH, equivalent to around 628,583 USD, were stolen.
