    "description": "<p>The insider attack was performed by 2 team members: front-end and back-end developers.<br><br>Developers had access to the key contracts as they were members of a multisignature account, which requires only 2 signs.<br><br>1. Whitehat reported found bug in the vault contracts to the Immunefi team<br>2. Whitehat received bug bounty and the core team of Blizzard asked the back-end developer to remove retired vaults, put 0 reward rate and disable deposits.<br>3. Front-end and back-end started testing new vaults:<br>https://snowtrace.io/tx/0xf66a695d7df17771a649d9bf2c6076c324453c7a199d6da78dbc58b0baf3f48e<br><br>4. Back-end dev set the <u>rewardMintRate</u> to 50 BLIZZ per block<br>5. Developers exploited the harvesting issue:<br>https://snowtrace.io/tx/0xa7818cb803c1f29f4e5fd0d1cbc591e8514e07db4ed6042f76e23298c84b0363<br><br>6. Front-end dev had removed the retired PNG-AVAX vaults from the website front.<br>7. Developers exploited a single USDC vault:<br>https://snowtrace.io/address/0xdb6969402dd0b431d26cdf539acffc6db649b64e#code<br><br>8. Developers dumped received tokens:<br>https://snowtrace.io/tx/0x7cd6c8c8d8fb5d60a08780d95df01a257a00be910b3445130a2649394a00e482<br><br>9. Attackers used Anyswap bridge to transfer funds on Ethereum, and then, on the Binance Smart Chain<br>https://snowtrace.io/tx/0x198c7303d1e9f05ac9da81b7d4b2a02c2ffcb735b56c84c331c7a3e00a111495<br><br>10. Stolen funds were deposited into Tornado Cash mixer at:<br>https://explorer.bitquery.io/bsc/txs/transfers?sender=0xbb2c0ef4bad535e042b0f2686f83abec7e2ea965&amp;currency=BNB&amp;receiver=0x0d5550d52428e7e3175bfc9550207e4ad3859b17<br><br>The exploit is described in 3 steps:</p><p>- Modify the <u>rewardRate</u>, by calling <u>setRewardMintRate</u>(uint256 _rate) with the following parameter: 50000000000000000000</p><p>- Deposit any amount of USDC and wait until the desired amount of tokens has been minted</p><p>- Call <u>claim</u>() to transfer the rewards from the origin pool and additional minted token rewards from the aggregator to the beneficiary.</p>",
