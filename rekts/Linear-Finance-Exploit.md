 **Details of the Exploit**

Linear Finance, a non-custodial, cross-chain compatible, delta-one asset protocol, was exploited on Sep 21, 2023. The attacker minted an unlimited supply of LAAVE, traded it for LUSD on the Linear Exchange, and sold the tokens on PancakeSwap and Ascendex decentralized exchanges. As a result, all lUSD liquidity was drained on both platforms. The LUSD value collapsed to zero when its liquidity pools were drained. Despite the attack, the protocol's LINA token appears to be unaffected, trading flat at $0.011 at the time of writing. All smart contracts and bridges on the protocol have been halted by the team. The stolen funds were transferred to another EOA and then deposited into TornadoCash. The exact loss amount is not known, but the confirmed loss is more than 1,000 BNB (211,726 USD) as of Sep 26, 2023.
