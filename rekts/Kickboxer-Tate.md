**Quick Summary**

Kickboxer Tate project was rugpulled by the deployer-related address, which drained roughly 33,000 $USD worth of $ETH.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

Kickboxer Tate is an ERC20 token trading on the UniswapV2 pool in the Ethereum network. The token experienced a significant drop after a malicious action in which the initial buyers and deployers coordinated to drain liquidity from the pool. Investigation revealed that an EOA address bought 38,000,000 $KBTate tokens with 0.25 $ETH, then dumped them for 17.4 $ETH in one transaction to another EOA address controlled by the scammer's group.

The attacker transferred funds to their own account, which received additional cash injections from the tokens deployer.
