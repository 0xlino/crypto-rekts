The project team initially announced it was exploited, but further investigation shows evidence of an exit scam. The incident was possible due to a change in the signer wallet, which allowed the attacker to redeem a coupon that would otherwise have been rejected. The attacker used the coupon system to claim a coupon worth $2.1 million and then transferred the reward balance to their wallet. The Yield Robot deployer later used the wallet to create an unverified contract, which was likely a copy of the original contract, but with the deposit address changed to the attacker's wallet. New deposits were made, but later reverted back to the original deposit wallet.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Set signer TX:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x31bf8f7f5ac1664ba1b45985f4070c7358e57db3f7ca26f058910b4c2f156cab</p><p><br></p><p>Rug TX:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xb66c4003aa9861222a69ec63f21c076e20678803ad065856ced0c26f670995ed</p><p><br></p><p>Scammer address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x8f2dba873c24498f4a82f990ab04cb5aa5654a4a</p>",
