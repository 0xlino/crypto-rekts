A new update from the exchange team indicated that as much as $2m was lost.<br><br>Gatecoin has claimed that it lost as much as 185,000 ethers and 250 bitcoins, an amount worth roughly $2.14m at press time.<br><br>Gatecoin said in a statement:<br>\"We have previously communicated the fact that most clients\u2019 crypto-asset funds are stored in multi-signature cold wallets. However, the malicious external party involved in this breach, managed to alter our system so that ETH deposit transfers by-passed the multi-sig cold storage and went directly to the hot wallet during the breach period. This means that losses of ETH funds exceed the 5% limit that we imposed on our hot wallets.\"</p>",
