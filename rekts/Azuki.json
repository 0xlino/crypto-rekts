The scam used malicious links posing as a \"land mint\" for the Azuki NFT project to trick users into signing transactions that drained assets from their wallets. The Azuki Twitter account was deleted, and the official account removed from Twitter search results within an hour. The Azuki team confirmed that the account had been compromised and is working to regain control. The NFT collection has been targeted by scammers before.</p>",
