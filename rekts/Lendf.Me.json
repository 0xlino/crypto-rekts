The function was hooked by embedding an extra withdraw() function, which allowed the attacker to increase their internal record of imBTC collateral amount without actually depositing the amount. The attacker first deposited a specific quantity of imBTC into Lendf.Me. However, in the second supply(), the attacker not only supplied 0.00000001 imBTC but also withdrew 290 imBTC within the hook by hijacking the transferFrom() function within doTransferIn(). As a result, 290 imBTC were deducted from the attacker's balance under the integrated withdraw(). When the execution returned to supply(), however, the balance was reset to 290 imBTC. This allowed the attacker to modify the internal record of the imBTC collateral amount in Lendf.Me. With a big enough collateral value, the attacker was thus able to borrow all available assets from multiple liquidity pools.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>The attacker's address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xa9bf70a420d364e923c74448d9d817d3f2a77822</p><p>The transaction behind the attack:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xae7d664bdfcc54220df4f18d339005c6faf6e62c9ca79c56387bc0389274363b</p><p>The withdrawal of the funds by the attacker:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9a5899d2151d84a9a8dccd1b1a03abbdf91ea83b1f78f3c631b858c20658c12d</p>",
