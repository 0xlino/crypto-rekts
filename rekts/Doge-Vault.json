As a result, DogeVault is encouraging users not to transfer any funds to its wallet addresses while the attack is under investigation, and explained:<br>\u201cWe are currently in the process of identifying the extent of the attack and potential impact on users\u2019 funds. This involves salvaging existing wallet data from an off-site backup.\u201d<br><br>DogeVault has indicated that it will issue an additional statement on its findings within 24 to 48 hours of the initial post.<br><br>The overall loss of funds sustained by the site is as-yet unknown, though The Cryptocurrency Times has estimated that as many as 111m DOGE (nearly $51,000 at press time) could have been lost in the theft.</p>",
