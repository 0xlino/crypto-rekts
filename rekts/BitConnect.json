    "description": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>BitConnect was a Ponzi Scheme that managed to raise approx. $2 billion dollars from investors before it collapsed.</p><p><strong><br>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>BitConnect is a crypto lending platform, which claimed it used a trading bot for earning interest.<br><br>In fact, BitConnect was suspected of being a Ponzi scheme because of its multilevel marketing structure and impossibly high payouts (1% daily compounded interest). BitConnect interest fluctuated greatly with the volatility of Bitcoin, which its value was tied to.<br><br>The BitConnect Coin was among the world's top 20 most successful cryptocurrency tokens until its price collapsed after traders began losing confidence. BCC rose from a post ICO price of $0.17 to an all-time high of US$463 in December 2017; it declined to US$0.40 as of March 11, 2019. BitConnect released outstanding loans at a rate of US$363.62 to the BitConnect Wallet in form of BCC. However, soon after that news the internal exchange price and liquidity collapsed resulting in a nearly complete loss of value. Prosecutors managed to seize crypto assets worth $57 million from Arcaro, BitConnect's biggest partner in North America.</p>",
