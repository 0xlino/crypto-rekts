**Quick Summary**

RESDAO token experienced a rugpull, with the scammer removing liquidity worth 750,000 $USD. 

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

RESDAO is a BEP20 token trading on PancakeSwap. On 18th April, the project was subjected to a significant rug pull. The deployer removed liquidity worth 343,000 and 108,000 $USD from two transactions respectively. Also, an unknown address swapped $RESDAO tokens for $WBNB in another transaction worth approximately 67,000 $USD.

Furthermore, team members dumped their tokens in another sale transaction that netted them around 232,000 $USD.

The attacker then transferred all proceeds to Tornado Cash.
