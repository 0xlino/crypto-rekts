The first two attacks on June 24 resulted in the minting of 203,000 xUSD and 13.5 xBTC. On June 27, a vulnerability in the conversion verification of xAsset allowed an unknown amount of XHV to be minted. The final attack on June 29 exploited a vulnerability that enabled the minting of 9 million xUSD. In response to these attacks, the chain initiated a rollback and implemented a hard fork to fix the known vulnerabilities in protocol minting.</p><p><br></p>",
