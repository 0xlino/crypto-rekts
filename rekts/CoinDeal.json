The SEC alleges that Neil Chandran, Garry Davidson, Michael Glaspie, Amy Mossel, and Linda Knott falsely claimed that investors could generate returns by investing in a blockchain technology company named CoinDeal that was sold for trillions of dollars. The SEC says that the defendants collectively misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds for personal use, and Chandran used investor funds to purchase items such as cars, real estate, and a boat. The SEC seeks to reclaim the money allegedly stolen by the defendants along with pre-judgment interest, penalties, and permanent injunctions against all defendants. Chandran is already behind bars, awaiting trial in a separate investment fraud case under the U.S. Justice Department.</p>",
