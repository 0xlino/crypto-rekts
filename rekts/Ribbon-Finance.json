The on-chain analysis revealed that the attack has common features with the DNS attack on Convex Finance and was made by the same hacker team. Hackers created a similar website with a malicious contract that required calling the approve() function.</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\"><br></p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\"><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Scammer address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xb73261481064f717a63e6f295d917c28385af9aa</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Contract creator address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x47832f5505847b6e1cce802201c55ad885146fc6</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Malicious contract address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x65a8ec2c367a2d60efc1944c6eab614d73453b2f</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Transferring 16.5 $WBTC from \"victim\" to scammer address transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd09057f1fdb3fa97d0ed7e8ebd8fd31dd9a0b5b61a29a22b46985d6217510850</p>",
