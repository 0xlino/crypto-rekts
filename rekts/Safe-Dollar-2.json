These fees are meant to be borne by the user, however, they were taken from the rewarder balance instead during withdrawal transactions.<br><br>The hacker used a deposit/withdraw loop to progressively drain the pool's PLX balance over the course of 101 transactions, resulting in a hugely inflated <u>accSdoPerShare</u> of 1,142,913,215,739,484,400 SDO being awarded for each PLX contributed.<br><br>Claiming rewards on the initial deposit produced a total of 831,309,277,244,108,000 SDO which were sold by the attacker.</p>",
