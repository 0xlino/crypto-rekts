**Quick Summary**

PlantWorld was exploited by a flash loan attack. The hacker profited for 24483 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

PlantWorld is BEP20 token trading on PancakeSwap and can't be confused with other tokens with the same PLTD symbol. The attacker took 666,000 $BUSD as a flash loan and bought 1,570,000 $PLTD tokens using a smart contract with an unverified source code. Consequently, $PLTD tokens were used to manipulate inner variables and a large amount of additional $PLTD was used to drain the liquidity from the Pancake pool. The attacker was able to withdraw 690,000 $BUSD and profited for 24,483 $BUSD.
