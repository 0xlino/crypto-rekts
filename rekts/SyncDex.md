**Quick Summary**

SyncDex Finance rugpulled by the deployer. The scammer stole around 442,470 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

The SyncDex Finance project showed several red flags even before it was rugpulled. Comments were muted on Twitter, and words were added to ban lists on Telegram/Discord channels to prevent concerns about the project from being raised. Moreover, their contract did not allow for withdrawing pledged funds, which is always a warning sign.

The staking pool allowed only admins to withdraw funds while users' assets remained locked up permanently.

Eventually, the deployer pulled out around 442,470 $USD worth of liquidity and vanished into thin air. The official Twitter and website of the project went shut down.
