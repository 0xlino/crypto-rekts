This feature was intended to be implemented on the next dApp update, however, it\u2019s been around for about 1 month on the contract side.<br><br>The issue is in the line below, which assumes that there can not be a malicious smart contract on the pool that is called on <u>receiveHop</u>(_pool):<br><br>tokenPool.stakingToken.approve(address(_newPool),<br>tokenPool.stakingToken.totalSupply());<br><br>By approving the totalSupply to the new pool, Contract B was able to have allowance to spend the staking contract tokens. This basically means they were able to withdraw them from the staking contract at a whim once that initial setup was made.<br><br>The attacker:<br>- created contract A</p><p>- created contract B</p><p>- the attacker contract then proceeded to buy some EarnHub, stake it, and make it hop to contract B (makeHop(contractBaddress))</p><p>- after receiving the hop, the contract was able to drain the funds from the staking contract by just using the <u>transferFrom</u>() function repeated times.<br><br>The example transaction:<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x40e69064c70d7db8b2dcbad441da9a06a507f8f90959da3c2583242f89e01d3c<br><br>Stolen funds were deposited into Tornado Cash mixer:<br>https://explorer.bitquery.io/bsc/address/0x3d98aee279c82d8178b87d9d4dc442d65224dacc/outflow</p>",
