The frontend was compromised, and users were urged not to interact with the platform. The Velodrome team regained control of their domain after a social engineering attack on their provider. However, the provider was exploited again, and the frontend was compromised a second time. The domain was eventually restored and locked at the TLD level. The stolen funds, totaling 42,000 USD, were distributed among multiple addresses and deposited into KuCoin.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker Addresses:</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xf64fCEdFCe714Bbe835761e54D7067f2f8231443</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x02BA13f39D7df9C3F7592257b636eD6C7CC4ae78</p><p><br></p><p>KuCoin Deposit Transactions:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf51eac8b8ac04eae9212f02250f05cb02f95ccc9316b5f2469272420f2ca3e64</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8ac2654b5526b4f9448529390f6679ada8b3dc7816525c9b7b9d8d46c3dc509e</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x607d00b8d3170407aafbb1bc45336a629d4304acfbc5a6eec8d5e455000c670e</p>",
