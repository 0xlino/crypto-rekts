**Quick Summary**

The Bitfinex crypto exchange was hacked for more than 94,000 $BTC. Accident was the second-largest breach of crypto exchange up to that time

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

A private key from the BitGo multisignature wallet was leaked (Multi-signature wallets: needs 2 of 3 signatures. Bitfinex held two of the keys (including one offline) and BitGo used the third to co-sign transactions.)  
  


BitGo founders mentioned that it was not an issue with their multisig product. So, the most likely scenario was a compromised secret key.  
  


After the attack, Bitfinex managed to track some funds and also issued refunds to its customers in the form of equity. All losses from the attack were equally distributed among the users.  
  
UPDATE  
  
The Justice Department announced it seized more than $3.6 billion in allegedly stolen cryptocurrency linked to the 2016 hack of Bitfinex. As part of the operation, authorities detained a New York couple on allegations they planned to launder the digital goods:
