A Coinbase client lost all funds from their account through a SIM port hack.  
  
The attacker ported the victim's SIM card to a phone that they control. The attacker then initiated the password reset flow on the victim's email account. A verification code was sent from the email provider to the victim's phone number â€” which was intercepted by the attacker. The attacker received all access and drained the Coinbase wallet.
