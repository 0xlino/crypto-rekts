The compromised account deleted admin roles from the project team, so no one could prevent this immediately.<br><br>As a result, users spent approx 73 ETH which were stolen by this address:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0x67542f6e4ea651f4c72ab24abf2eb9c2c202fce1<br><br>After, the Discord server ownership was regained by the team.</p>",
