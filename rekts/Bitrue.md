Singapore-based crypto exchange Bitrue has suffered a major hack, losing 9.3 million XRP and 2.5 million cardano (ADA) from its hot wallet.  
  
At the time of the breach — 1 a.m. GMT+8 June 27 — the stolen funds would have been worth over $4.5 million in XRP (valued at $0.488) and $237,500 in ADA (valued at $0.095), according to CoinMarketCap data.  
  
The exchange states that a purportedly single hacker first “exploited a vulnerability in our Risk Control team's 2nd review process to access the personal funds of about 90 Bitrue users,” subsequently using this first experience to access the exchange’s hot wallet and steal the cryptocurrency.  
  
Any user accounts that were affected by the breach have had their assets replaced
