Thus, they promised a yield of more than 183k%. At the end of June 2022, Freedom Protocol invested in the Raccoon Network crypto project and announced the beginning of cooperation. Freedom launched its IDO, and people began to buy more and more $FREE tokens, and this was just the beginning of the scam. After the IDO, users noticed that they could no longer sell their tokens, and all funds invested in the project were sent to a third-party address: https://bscscan.com/address/0xf800f2744fde6bda11e80b7de0954ac3dc469336</p><p data-v-51e0c2ec=\"\">Examining the transaction chain of one of the involved addresses, it is seen that tokens were withdrawn through Binance Hot Wallets:</p><p data-v-51e0c2ec=\"\">https://bscscan.com/address/0xdcf495911dfb4266a9e3dfe906c3f6214c843762#tokentxns</p><p><br></p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\"><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Involved addresses:</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Scammer address (A): https://bscscan.com/address/0xf800f2744fde6bda11e80b7de0954ac3dc469336</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Scammer address (B): https://bscscan.com/address/0x56bb6513ab4dddbba9c0708b3beed8e2ef54502f</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Scammer address (C): https://bscscan.com/address/0x088f4818098028d8c77b7701934374c1117f5b70</p><p style=\"margin:0cm;background:white;\">Scammer address (D): https://bscscan.com/address/0x4411e7aaca131684c33d297622f747369fbe1214</p>",
