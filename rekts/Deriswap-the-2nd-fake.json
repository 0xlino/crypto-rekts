    "description": "<p>The team merely had a Github profile and a Telegram group, without a full-fledged website and documentation. They posted a bogus Quantstamp audit on Github to confuse the community. The project team pointed to an official report by Andre Cronje about a December conversation between Yearn and Sushi to show even more legit intentions. It's a second time, where anon dev teams use bogus Deriswap contracts to replicate Andre Cronje's work.<br><br>The contract deployer added initial liquidity at:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x794fae3493861f3ae584a0b73d12f09d397f7a927fc0c948b9372b8fbd6893ee<br><br>The liquidity was removed by the contract deployer at:<br>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x794fae3493861f3ae584a0b73d12f09d397f7a927fc0c948b9372b8fbd6893ee</p>",
