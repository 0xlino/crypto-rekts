The attacked contacted with Bitstamp team and sent a number of attachments via email. One of these, UPE_application_form.doc, contained obfuscated malicious VBA script. When opened, this script ran automatically and pulled down a malicious file from IP address 185.31.209.145, thereby compromising the machine. Ultimately, the attackers were able to access two servers containing the wallet.dat file for Bitstampâ€™s hot wallet and the passphrase for that file.  
  
On 4th January, the attacker drained the Bitstamp wallet.  
  
Bitstamp lost 18,866 BTC from its hot wallet, worth approximately $5,263,614 at a time when the price of bitcoin averaged $279.
