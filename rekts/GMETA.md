**Quick Summary**

GMETA token was rugpulled by the deployer and linked addresses, resulting in a loss of 3,675,612 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

GMETA, a BEP20 token, fell victim to a rugpull. The token deployer transferred a significant amount of $GMETA tokens to an EOA address on February 4, 2023. A portion of these tokens was moved to another EOA which sold the tokens and drained over 2.3 million $USDT from the PancakePool. The remaining tokens were transferred between multiple EOA addresses, and one of them drained the pool for an additional 1.3 million $USDT, of which 1 million $USDT was transferred to an unverified contract.
