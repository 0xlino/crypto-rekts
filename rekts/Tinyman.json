When a user invokes the protocol's burn function, they should be rewarded with two different tokens:</p><p>https://docs.tinyman.org/design-doc<br><br>The value of each token is determined by the quantity contained in the protocol.<br><br>The attacker took use of a flaw in the Tinyman pools' contract code, which enabled them to obtain the same token twice after a burn instead of two separate tokens. This worked in their favor since it allowed the attacker to take twice as many gobtc rather than a mixture of gobtc and ALGO tokens. Because gobtc is far more valuable than ALGO, the attacker was able to profit significantly and drain nearly $3 million in gobtc and goeth from the Tinyman pool across numerous transactions. These tokens were then exchanged for stablecoins in pools and withdrawn to various exchanges and wallets.<br><br>The original attacker's vulnerability was copied by other wallets that utilized it to attack the protocol. As a result, the Tinyman team advised all users to remove their funds from impacted pools.</p>",
