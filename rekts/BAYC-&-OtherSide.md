**Quick Summary**

Boris Wagner's Discord was compromised, which the hacker took advantage of by posting a phishing link with airdrop through his account.

 **  
Details of the Exploit**

The Bored Ape Yacht Club is a collection of 10000 unique Bored Ape NFTs— unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain.

After gaining access to the employee’s account, scammers shared a phishing link from Vagner’s Discord account into the official BAYC, MAYC and Otherside groups. The community, without suspecting anything suspicious, without hesitation followed the link and clicking on the "get airdrop" button signed a transaction to give all their funds to the scammers.
