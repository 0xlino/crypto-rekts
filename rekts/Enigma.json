Whoever orchestrated it grabbed money from the Enigma community, people who joined the company\u2019s mailing list, or a Slack group of over 9,000 users to learn more about its ICO in September.<br><br>The hacker posted Slack messages, altered the website, and spoofed emails to a community list that were made to look official and urged money to be sent to their crypto wallet.<br><br>That\u2019s netted the hacker 1,492 in Ether (worth $494,170.68), according to Etherscan:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0x29d7d1dd5b6f9c864d9db560d72a247c178ae86b<br><br>Users on Reddit found that Enigma CEO Guy Zyskind\u2019s email was accessed by the hacker. His email had been part of hacking of different services in the past and had been dumped on the internet, but seemingly Zyskind had not taken the time to change the password:<br>https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6v0vei/warning_enigma_website_and_slack_probably_hacked/</p>",
