According to a Medium blog post the company published, what truly happened isn’t yet clear, although several indicators point them towards a group of hackers that hacked another project dubbed CypheriumChain for more than 17,000 ETH (about $9.8 million).

  


The hacker(s), according to Taylor, collected its funds from multiple sources in a single wallet, before transferring them to a larger one:

After the theft, the organization’s team managed to identify an attempt to dump its TAY tokens on the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange IDEX:
