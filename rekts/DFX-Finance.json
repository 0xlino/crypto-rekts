The attacker siphoned off 4,445,279 $USD worth of assets, and an MEV bot was able to frontrun the hacker for the additional 3,200,000 $USD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>DFX Finance is a trading protocol providing flash loans. The attacker drained 4,445,279 $USD worth of assets in various tokens and transferred 2962 $ETH through Tornado Cash. 545,312 $USD worth of $CADC stays at the attacker's address, and 135,265 $USD worth of $TRYb remains at the malicious contract used for an attack. The malicious actor exploited a known smart contract vulnerability that allows passing the balance check after a flashloan and gives approval of tokens to the attacker. The MEV bot was able to frontrun the hacker during token transfers for an additional 3,200,000 $USD in $USDC, $NZDS, $CADC, and $GYEN tokens. The DFX team claims that they are contacting the MEV bot owners to return the lost funds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x14c19962e4a899f29b3dd9ff52ebfb5e4cb9a067</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x6cfa86a352339e766ff1ca119c8c40824f41f22d</p><p><br></p><p>MEV bot:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xfde0d1575ed8e06fbf36256bcdfa1f359281455a</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transactions list:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x6cfa86a352339e766ff1ca119c8c40824f41f22d</p>",
