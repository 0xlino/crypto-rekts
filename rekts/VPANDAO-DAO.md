**Quick Summary**

VPANDA DAO project was rugpulled by team-related EOA, leading to a loss of 869,463 $USD.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

VPANDA DAO, a BEP20 token project on Binance Smart Chain, underwent an exit scam by a mysterious exploiter. The scam began when the deployer of the token moved a large number of VPANDA tokens to a special contract named VpandaBank. The owner of this contract was then changed to another EOA, the alleged scammer.

  


VpandaBank had a privileged function that allowed the owner to withdraw any number of VPANDA tokens. This function, named 'withdraw', was exploited by the scammer to transfer a significant amount of VPANDA tokens to themselves. They then drained the liquidity from the PancakePool. In the end, the drained funds were transferred to yet another EOA address.

  


The total funds lost resulted in 869,463 $USD.
