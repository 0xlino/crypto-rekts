The hacker used the Factory contract's <u>receive</u>() method. The attacker was required to pay a fee of 0.005 ETH in <u>_chargeFee</u>. There are no real authentication checks, and just one signature is necessary. To get around this, the attacker simply signed signatures with new addresses each time. In the <u>_receive()</u> function, the volume argument is subsequently sent to the attacker's address.</p>",
