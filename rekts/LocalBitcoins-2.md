A security vulnerability occurred at the prominent over-the-counter Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins. Attackers were able to replace the official URL to the exchange's forum with a false link that took visitors to a phony website that looked like the discussion board but gathered information from users who tried to join in.  
  
The attackers utilized the information they gathered to steal 7.9 Bitcoin (about $27,000 at the time) from at least six user accounts.
