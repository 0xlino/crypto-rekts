A fraudster known as "cryptopunksbot" promised NFT investors the chance to win one of ten exclusive NFT avatars on CryptoPunk's Discord server. Stazie, a co-founder of the NFT game project Hedgie, accepted the bogus offer, but it cost him 16 CryptoPunks, which might be worth more than $1 million. Stazie inadvertently sent the wallet seed phrase to the scammer, resulting in the funds' loss.
