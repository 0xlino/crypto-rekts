The project was hacked through a vulnerability found within their deposit function. When a user used the deposit function, it created a new contract and deposited tokens into that contract. The issue arose because this newly created contract had an \"approve\" function that gave unrestricted access to $META tokens without any restrictions or limitations. An attacker took advantage of this by deploying a malicious smart contract with unverified source code, and draining mass amounts of funds from users who had deposited $POT tokens onto their platform. The exploiter was able to steal 2,518 $BNB which is worth 803,242 $USD at current market rates. All the stolen money transferred through TornadoCash.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x0d1969a30bb4ba02e731862edbced5f5abba8373</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Contract:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xc6e451c8fa3418b703121ac23e44803d143c5d5c</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transaction Example:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x0ed5cc9abb0f97b27a673cc6f89d6f2e30bde01834887a21092f38c0dc59c4c4</p>",
