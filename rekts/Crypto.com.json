Transactions were being approved without the 2FA authentication control being inputted by the user. This led to an immediate investigation, during which all withdrawals on the platform were suspended. The impacted accounts were fully restored, and all customer 2FA tokens were revoked. Additional security measures were put in place, requiring all customers to re-login and set up their 2FA token. The withdrawal infrastructure was down for approximately 14 hours.</p><p><br></p><p>Stolen funds:</p><p>- 4,836.26 ETH</p><p>- 443.93 BTC</p><p>- $66,200 in other currencies</p><p><br></p><p>The stolen funds were deposited into a Tornado Cash mixer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>The attacker's address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x6e1218c55f1acb588fc5e55b721f1183d7d29d3d</p><p>The transaction behind the attack:</p><p>https://bloxy.info/txs/calls_from/0x6e1218c55f1acb588fc5e55b721f1183d7d29d3d?signature_id=994162&amp;smart_contract_address_bin=0x722122df12d4e14e13ac3b6895a86e84145b6967</p>",
