**Quick Summary**

OKX DEX suffered an access control exploit on Dec 12, 2023, resulting in a loss of 2,390,976 USD worth of assets, including USDT, USDC, and WETH.

  


 **Details of the Exploit**

OKX DEX, a trading aggregator for cross-chain transactions, experienced an access control exploit on December 12, 2023. The proxy admin owner upgraded the DEX proxy contract to a new implementation contract, which may have led to the compromise of the private key of the OKX DEX. After the upgrade, tokens started being stolen from the platform. The stolen native ETH was distributed between three addresses, while the rest of the stolen stable coins were bridged to Arbitrum and Avalanche chains via Stargate Bridge. The DEX proxy was removed from OKX's platform's trusted list following the incident. The total loss amounted to 2,390,976 USD worth of assets, including 142,034 USDT, 475,929 USDC, and 799.77 WETH.
