    "description": "<p>Anti-scam vigilance War on Rugs, a self-described collection of smart contract auditors and blockchain developers, offered itself as a resource for verifying the credentials of a DeFi project, warning of projects it deemed insecure.<br><br>Later, War or Rugs created their own token - Fairmoon, which is the clone of the Safemoon. After the token launch, some insider wallets bought FAIRMOON before War on Rugs audit on some over $40k, which later were dumped and brought $1,800,00 of profit:<br>https://bscscan.com/token/0xfe75cD11E283813eC44B4592476109Ba3706cef6?a=0x485d2f761089b01623d3d6d31fd06e7c75d0373c<br><br>To calm down the community, the project announced migration to a new token. However, Shappy aka WarOnRugs completed his 2nd exit scam and again ran away with at least 1,170 BNB ($500,000 at this point). The total amount by which the community was defrauded thus amounts to at least $2,300,000.<br><br>The transaction of the second rug pull:<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xef7cff7b64bde0ab53f62ba0b9fc367c38167fcf8401f35fbcff00d20d4fccc3</p>",
