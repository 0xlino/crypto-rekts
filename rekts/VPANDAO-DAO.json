The scam began when the deployer of the token moved a large number of VPANDA tokens to a special contract named VpandaBank. The owner of this contract was then changed to another EOA, the alleged scammer.</p><p><br></p><p>VpandaBank had a privileged function that allowed the owner to withdraw any number of VPANDA tokens. This function, named 'withdraw', was exploited by the scammer to transfer a significant amount of VPANDA tokens to themselves. They then drained the liquidity from the PancakePool. In the end, the drained funds were transferred to yet another EOA address.</p><p><br></p><p>The total funds lost resulted in 869,463 $USD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Deployer Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xa5307fc87d0d31d9C0be9c89c9E94f5C2B20EE2A</p><p><br></p><p>Scammer Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xea7ba48a2b2690d19e54df12a56ccd73ffe821bf</p><p><br></p><p>Funds Holder Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x33D2a493CEa00918b02239604b94AD906d6eaF65</p><p><br></p><p>Liquidity Drain Transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xe0b89f37a4215cce25af24dc23cdccecd84f55698179c59b29e34e2da523a2da</p><p><br></p><p>Funds Transfer Transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x839bc7a9132be6a8f369366361d7c9fa43df363fa2bc19dcc0860a955d18539a</p>",
