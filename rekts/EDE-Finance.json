The project</span> was exploited through oracle manipulation which resulted in a loss of 658,370 $USD. A white hat hacker was able to exploit the project's vault and stole the assets. Consequently, 420,170 $USD were returned by the white hat to the project. An on-chain message was sent by the hacker with the following text: \"All trades that were executed were using prices signed/produced by the devs which allowed anyone to take advantage of these prices and easily empty out the entire ELP pool with just a few transactions. The malicious activity involved intentionally signing incorrect prices to manipulate users' positions and steal their funds while implementing backdoors that allowed them to force liquidate any position they desired. The whole pool was always at risk as there were additional vulnerabilities present too provided you agreed upon certain terms.\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://arbiscan.io/address/0x80826E9801420E19a948b8Ef477Fd20f754932DC</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction example:</p><p>https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x3758a4b7338d8c3bd39072221ff3b6b6a59d36f3d885934f1b0081877f35163e</p><p><br></p><p>Attacker's message:<br>https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x76799a5759edbf0bfebe317954369e00026c4a87da98604209dfdaa42ccbcfb0</p>",
